112,['41099-021pieta.jpg'],The Man of Sorrows in the arms of God the Father with the Holy Ghost between them both is a kind of Seat of Mercy or more exactly a Trinity Piet&#224;.,0

131,['36867-pentapt3.jpg'],The pairing of Sts John the Baptist and John the Evangelist - the forerunner of Christ and the beloved disciple - to either side of the Madonna and Child is not uncommon and may relate either to the dedication of the chapel or to the name of the patron.,1
132,['36867-pentapt3.jpg'],"On the other hand, the presence of Sts Benedict (c. 480&#150;543) and Silvester Gozzolini (1177&#150;1267) virtually assures that the altarpiece was painted for a monastery of the Silvestrine order, which was founded by Silvester in 1231 and followed the rule of St Benedict",1

138,['08837-isaac.jpg'],"There are several preparatory studies for the painting, one of which is on the verso of a drawing for Massimo Massimi's Ecce Homo of 1607, making it safe to assume that Cigoli was working on both pictures at the same time.",1
139,['08837-isaac.jpg'],"Although The Sacrifice of Isaac was painted in Rome, the composition clearly recalls the Florentine tradition of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Andrea del Sarto.",1

141,['08837-isaac.jpg'],"Despite the inherent suspense of the narrative, the picture itself lacks dramatic tension.",1
142,['08837-isaac.jpg'],"Abraham's massive red tunic serves as a foil for Isaac's unblemished adolescent body, shifting the emphasis to the work's more lascivious characteristics.",0
143,['08837-isaac.jpg'],"When the picture was criticised for its sexually evocative content by a visitor to Arrigoni's villa, the cardinal made an eloquent defence of the artist and the painting.",1

644,['26351-poultry.jpg'],"Metsu's Poultry Seller depicts just such a group of varied items, arranged along the painting's lower and left-hand margins; the precision with which they have been painted testifies to a supreme virtuosity in the Feinmaler style, and is accentuated in part by the use of light and dark contrasts.",0

1298,['30009-lottery.jpg'],"But his close, frontal view of the street scene is original.",1
1299,['30009-lottery.jpg'],The painting is an exact rendering of the fa�ades of three houses in the Kalverstraat in Amsterdam which have an antiquarian interest that enhances the painting's historical value.,1
1300,['30009-lottery.jpg'],"The lottery office that the crowd is trying to enter was first inhabited by Clement de Jonghe, who posed for Rembrandt and was a publisher of Rembrandt's etchings.",1
1301,['30009-lottery.jpg'],"The house on the right was once occupied by Jacob van Ruisdael, the one on the left by Aert van der Neer",1
1302,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],This painting was mentioned by Carel van Mander in 1604 in his 'Schilderboeck'.,1
1303,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"He described the principal character of the painting as 'a Mad Meg pillaging at the mouth of Hell / seemingly perplexed / and cruelly and strangely attired', an evil and fearsome woman or witch.",1
1304,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],Van Mander remained vague about the actual significance of the painting.,1
1305,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],Perhaps it had already been forgotten by his time.,1
1306,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"We can be certain, however, that Bruegel gave the work a hidden allegorical or religious meaning, albeit one that remains a mystery.",1
1307,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"A great many experts have devoted their energies to solving the problem, but none has ever succeeded entirely in explaining the painting.",1
1308,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"Most of them focus on the possible symbolism of the large woman in the foreground, with her suit of armor, sword, cutlery and money-box.",0
1309,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"She has been variously interpreted as a symbol of heresy or violence, the personification of hum,an evil and an allegory of instability.",1
1310,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"Recently it was proposed that Meg symbolizes Madness, a vice taken in the 16th century to include insanity, rage, gluttony, lust, avarice and ambition, and that the giant figure in the centre of the painting is an allegory of Folly.",1
1311,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],The additional scenes surrounding the two figures illustrate the causes and repercussions of these two human failings.,0
1312,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],It was concluded that Bruegel's allegory was intended as an attack on both human nature and the political and religious situation in 16th-century Antwerp.,1
1313,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],We could fill a book with suggested interpretations of Mad Meg and it is highly doubtful whether it would bring the viewer any closer to the true meaning of the painting.,1
1314,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"Nevertheless, the work never fails to fascinate, even without specialist knowledge.",1
1315,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],No one can fail to appreciate its apocalyptic vision.,1
1316,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"For that reason, it has also been plausibly interpreted as the Breaking of the Seventh Seal, as recounted in the Book of Revelations.",1
1317,['06394-20dulle.jpg'],"Mad Meg is, indeed, reminiscent of the book of the Apocalypse",1
1318,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],During the second quarter of the 17th century a group of artists began to specialize in painting the life of soldiers.,1
1319,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],"Scenes of plunder and battle were depicted but the ancient battle of sexes, where the field of action was a room in an inn or a barrack, and in which the outcome of the struggle is not much in doubt, was more frequently represented.",1
1320,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],"Other popular subjects were soldiers drinking, smoking and gambling at cards or tric-trac, activities that contemporary predicants and moralists condemned as vices that endanger salvation.",1
1321,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],But it is doubtful if the painters of these scenes and their clients viewed them as pictorial reminders of the perils of sin and the inexorable need to lead a virtuous life.,1
1322,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],Pictures of the life of off-duty soldiers were called by the Dutch 'cortegaardjes' a corruption of the French term 'corps de garde'.,1
1323,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],The better ones show little movement or overt action.,1
1324,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],Painters of them had a special feeling for tonal values and their pictures take on a certain still-life quality.,1
1325,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],"In their half-dark interiors the light glitters over uniforms, and a fine subdued play of colours, mostly broken and harmonized by delicate half-tones, betrays the Dutch gift for intimate pictorial qualities and a subtle rendering of textures.",0
1326,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],"Some even anticipate the achievement of the high society painters of the following generation, when well-to-do burghers rather than soldiers and their friends became the favoured subject of genre painters.",1
1327,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],"Specialists in this category worked in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Delft, but seldom in Haarlem.",1
1328,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],The leading ones in Amsterdam were Willem Duyster and Pieter Codde.,1
1329,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],What sets Duyster's rare pictures apart from those made by his contemporaries is his distinct chiaroscuro and the refinement of his colours.,1
1330,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],He was also better able than any of them to convey the fascinating visual drama which can take place  when people do little more than confront each other.,1
1331,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],It is difficult to think of a painter of his time who surpasses his penetrating characterization of the personalities of the men gathered round a fireplace in the modest nocturnal scene in the Soldiers beside a Fireplace in the Philadelphia museum.,1
1332,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],"(Versions are also in the Hermitage, and in D�sseldorf.)",1
1333,['12470-soldiers.jpg'], ,1
1334,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],Duyster's approach is always original.,1
1335,['12470-soldiers.jpg'],His cortegaardjes and small pictures of dignified full-length single figures seen against dark backgrounds served as one of the points of departure for Terborch's great accomplishment in these branch of painting,1
1336,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"Philip IV was a bold and enthusiastic huntsman, it was usual for the king to ride out with a small retinue in the extensive game preserves of the densely wooded Pardo.",1
1337,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"Emperor Charles V had built a watchtower on the way to the mountainous hunting grounds of the Sierra, as a place to stop and rest before the most strenuous stage of the journey.",1
1338,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"This tower was known as the Torre de la Parada, and Philip, who was particularly fond of it, extended it to make a comfortable hunting lodge.",1
1339,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"He was in haste to see it furnished, and commissioned Rubens to provide a large collection of new pictures on mythological subjects.",1
1340,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"After 1638, when the building itself was completed, it was the task of Vel�zquez to decide how they should be hung, and to contribute a series of hunting portraits himself, to hang with other appropriate works already in existence and with pictures by Dutch masters.",1
1341,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"This project cost him a great deal of time and trouble, but it also won him increasing appreciation at court.",1
1342,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"Vel�zquez's three extant hunting portraits (Philip IV as a Hunter, Prince Baltasar Carlos as a Hunter, and Cardinal Infante Don Fernando as a Hunter) are life-size.",1
1343,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"Don Fernando, the king's younger brother, despite his spiritual calling, did not hesitate to indulge his passion for hunting.",1
1344,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"In this painting, showing him with his gun at the ready, he looks even more of a huntsman than his relations.",0
1345,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"His expressive outline balances the silhouette of the cinnamon-coloured dog sitting in front of him, a figure once again illustrating the court painter's skill in depicting animals.",0
1346,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"He pays them as much careful attention as he expends on human beings; while he is of course aware of the differences between animals and humans, he is also conscious of the dignity shared by all living creatures.",1
1347,['42241-0309vela.jpg'],"The natural elegance of a horse's head or the body of a dog, their fiery or faithful natures - few painters have captured the beauty and individuality of animals as unforgettably as Vel�zquez",1
1348,['15653-med_port.jpg'],This painting shows a capriccio of a Mediterranean Port with classical architectural ruins and the statue of Hercules,0
1349,['15601-12sasset.jpg'],"The painting, in which the head of the man and the hands of the figures are entirely overpainted, depicts Francesco Sassetti (1421-1490), general manager of the Medici bank, and (probably) his younger son Teodoro.",0
1350,['15601-12sasset.jpg'],Several portraits of Sassetti exist.,1
1351,['15601-12sasset.jpg'],"However, the ruined condition of the present painting precludes comparison with the datable likenesses of Sassetti",1

1354,['00656-lastsup.jpg'],In 1511 a contract was drawn up with Andrea del Sarto for the decoration of the Refectory.,1
1355,['00656-lastsup.jpg'],"Although commissioned at the beginning of his career, it was carried out slowly and was completed between 1520-25, a particularly fine period of the work of Andrea del Sarto.",1
1356,['00656-lastsup.jpg'],"Miraculously spared during the Siege of Florence in 1529-30, the fresco is placed under a large arch containing painted medallions with the Trinity and four Saints, protectors of the Vallombrosan Order.",1
1357,['00656-lastsup.jpg'],"Andrea's personality and background are evident in the fresco's innovations; he appears to be influenced by Leonardo and the Roman work of Michelangelo and Raphael, revealed in a work of magnificence and pre-baroque spontaneity",1
1358,['23499-vanitas3.jpg'],Three very similar paintings attributed to the British-Dutch painter Simon Luttichuijs show a number of etchings and paintings of old people by or after Rembrandt and especially Jan Lievens.,1
1359,['23499-vanitas3.jpg'],Two facing paintings resemble the old man and woman called Rembrandt's father and mother.,0
1360,['23499-vanitas3.jpg'],"However, the iconography of Luttichuijs's paintings, with their emphasis on mortality, the images seem merely to refer old age as such, not to specific individuals",1
1361,['03483-jerome1.jpg'],"In the second half of the fourteenth century, Augustinian nuns erected a church in the district of Cannareggio in Venice and dedicated the sacristy and a confraternity to St Jerome.",1
1362,['03483-jerome1.jpg'],They ambitiously decorated their headquarter with paintings depicting episodes from the life of the titular saint.,1
1363,['03483-jerome1.jpg'],"Bastiani's contribution to the cycle consisted of two huge canvases, the Communion of St Jerome, and the Funeral of St Jerome.",1

1402,['44042-3john.jpg'],"Rogier was obviously able to make effective use of this elaborate and artificial pose in various circumstances, and only the worldly magnificence of Salome's dress and the context cause the viewer to assess it differently here.",1
1403,['44042-3john.jpg'],"In addition, Salome's grave and melancholy face does not in fact differ much from the face of the Virgin Mary in that Annunciation, although in this later version it is leaning at rather too pronounced an angle to express grace.",1
1404,['44042-3john.jpg'],"The artist has not set out simply to make the figure of Salome merely despicable; indeed, in the context of this scene, her noble features give her a touch of complex ambivalence",1

1779,['06337-01games.jpg'],Their faces often appear ageless: perhaps the painter wished to warn the observer against frittering away his life as if it were a childlike game.,1

1804,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],The compositional idea is extravagant and totally unprecedented: an inextricable knot of figures and drapes that pivots around the bewildered youth in the foreground and culminates above in the two lightly hovering figures emerging from vague background.,0
1805,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],This complicated bunch of forms arranged in the shape of an upturned pyramid defies any attempt at a rational exploration or identification of planes.,0
1806,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],"The compositional complexity is accompanied by a significant and probably deliberate ambiguity in the representation of the subject, which may be interpreted as halfway between the theme of the Deposition and that of the Piet&#224; or Lamentation over the Dead Christ.",1
1807,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],"The painting appears to represent the moment in which the body of Christ, having been taken down from the cross, has just been removed from the mother's lap.",0

1810,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],"The twisted body of Christ is reminiscent of Michelangelo's Vatican Piet&#224; (1498).An intense spiritual participation in the grief of the event profoundly affects the expressions and attitudes of all the figures present, even that of the woman turned away from the onlooker, probably Mary Magdalene, who communicates her anguished psychological condition by reaching out sympathetically towards the swooning body of the Virgin.",1
1811,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],Some scholars have interpreted the two young figures holding up the deceased's body as angels in the act of drawing Christ away from the main group and leading him finally into the arms of his Father.,1
1812,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],"The general direction of the movement is, in fact, a rising one, and is created by the ethereal quality of the weightless figures, and their slow, almost dance-like rhythm.",0
1813,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],"The two presumed angelic presences, moreover, seem to be unaffected by the weight of the lifeless body, and the figure in the foreground appears to be in the act of raising himself up by lightly pressing down on the front part of his foot.",0
1814,['31985-1deposi.jpg'],"The intricately connected group of figures, involved in a highly dramatic atmosphere, takes on the appearance of a rich frieze in the harmony of highly refined colour tones of pinks, blues and greens.",0

2255,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"These were then meticulously retouched by the master so that they might be ultimately be described, at least in the final layers of paint, as his own works.",1
2256,['35538-01medici.jpg'],The entire commission was completed in only three years.,1
2257,['35538-01medici.jpg'],All of his prodigious culture was drawn on for these works: his encyclopaedic knowledge of classical mythology was exploited to the full in transforming the queen's entire career - Henri slipped rather into the background - into a kind of operatic sequence largely of Rubens' own invention.,1
2258,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"Metamorphosing life into myth, he freely mingled historical personages with the gods of Olympus, who came to represent them.",1
2259,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"The scheme of this apparatus was invented as he went along, the - often gratuitous - interpolations of the divine gracefully leavening the uneventful royal life.",1
2260,['35538-01medici.jpg'],It had required all of Rubens' imaginative resources and natural verve to ennoble and illustrate the relatively colourless circumstances of the Queen Mother's life.,1
2261,['35538-01medici.jpg'],These qualities were essential; Rubens' international renown depended on his success in this formidable commission.,1
2262,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"His solution was to populate his compositions with nude goddesses, pagan gods, curvaceous undines, mischievous tritons, and genii unspecified.",1
2263,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"His customary contrasts are at work in the playful opposition of gleaming cuirasses and lusty bodies, fragile silks and the rugged hulls of dreadnoughts.",0
2264,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"The poverty of his subject was utterly transcended; this is pure painting, nothing but painting.",1
2265,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"Certainly, it was not the rather heavy features of the Medici family, particularly evident in the queen, that had attracted Henri IV, but the scale of her dowry.",1
2266,['35538-01medici.jpg'],Rubens nevertheless contrived to render her portrait agreeable.,1
2267,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"He disguised her now as an attractive Bellona, now as a proud horsewoman in The Capture of Juliers.",0
2268,['35538-01medici.jpg'],"The royal couple become Olympian deities in The Meeting of Marie de M�dicis and Henri IV at Lyon, while The Fate Spinning Marie's Destiny and The Triumph of Truth became pretexts for a proliferation of female convexity",1

2270,['37530-5domeni.jpg'],The chapel was built in the late fifteenth century to house the relic of St Catherine's head in a marble tabernacle.,1
2271,['37530-5domeni.jpg'],Sodoma transformed the space to appear as if it were an open loggia resting on piers.,1

2273,['37530-5domeni.jpg'],Only the left-hand wall showing Catherine saving the soul of Niccol&#242; di Tuldo was completed by Sodoma.,0
2274,['37530-5domeni.jpg'],Here the artist uses particular means to bring us close to the scene: the lower balustrade is wide open; steps seem to lead out of the chapel to the site of the execution,0
2275,['39795-18barbar.jpg'],"This portrait is considered to be a replica in his own hand of an almost identical portrait in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, which identifies the subject as Daniele Barbaro in an inscription.",1

2280,['11016-410david.jpg'],"While Pope Pius VII remained in Paris after the consecration, David also painted his portrait and thereby joined an illustrious band of past artists - Raphael, Titian and Vel�zquez - as the painter of a pontiff.",1
2281,['11016-410david.jpg'],"David broke with protocol by sitting down while he worked, as previously tradition had dictated that the humble artist should kneel to paint the Pope.",1
2282,['11016-410david.jpg'],"David, though, did appreciate the honour bestowed upon him and apparently put on fine clothes and wore a sword as he worked.",1
2283,['11016-410david.jpg'],He responded warmly to the venerable old pontiff and was both delighted and moved by the benediction that he received from the hand of Pius,1
2284,['39752-01schiav.jpg'],The portraits from the early period of Titian are strongly realistic.,1
2285,['39752-01schiav.jpg'],"Among them the portrait of a woman, called La Schiavone, is of remarkably fine quality.",1
2286,['39752-01schiav.jpg'],"Titian poses his sitters in such a way as to make the most of a novel compositional idea; the figures stand out in bold relief against the plain background and the colour emphasizes the unusual lighting, revealing the mood of the sitters as well as capturing their physical presence.",0
2287,['39752-01schiav.jpg'],The inclusion of the sitter's portrait carved in stone may refer to the much discussed issue of the relative merits of painting and sculpture,1

2342,['35708-jewish_c.jpg'],These works are moralizing landscapes that were painted with a deliberate allegorical programme.,1
2343,['35708-jewish_c.jpg'],"The combination of their conspicuous tombs, ruins, large dead beech trees, broken trunks, and rushing streams alludes to the familiar themes of transience and the vanity of life and the ultimate futility of human endeavour, while the burst of light that breaks through the ravening clouds in each painting, their rainbows and the luxuriant growth that contrasts with the dead trees offer a promise of hope and renewed life.",0
2344,['35708-jewish_c.jpg'],The masterliness of the Dresden painting lies in the artist's clear and concentrated presentation of these ideas.,1
2345,['35708-jewish_c.jpg'],"The eye focuses on the three tombs in the middle distance, where the light is centralized.",0
2346,['35708-jewish_c.jpg'],"They present a truthful picture of the actual, identifiable sarcophagi as they can still be seen in the Portuguese-Jewish Cemetery at Ouderkerk on the Amstel River near Amsterdam.",0

2358,['35708-jewish_c.jpg'],The iconographical programme of Ruisdael's two versions of the Jewish Cemetery leaves no doubt that they were intended as moralizing landscapes.,1

2362,['35708-jewish_c.jpg'],"Were these motifs invariably intended by the artist as symbols of transience and the vanity of life, and does the handful of them that include rainbows allude to hope?",1
2363,['35708-jewish_c.jpg'],"It has been argued that this is indeed the case, and that these motifs not only offer the iconographical essence of Ruisdael's landscapes but offer the key to the meaning to seventeenth-century landscape painting.",1

2579,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"The group of fourteen paintings, broken up at the end of the 16th century, was contained within a wooden decoration made by Baccio d'Agnolo.",1
2580,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"In this panel the thesis proposed by Mannerism is fully elaborated: the painter is no longer to be bound by perspective, or by the necessity of presenting his subject in a rational, objective manner.",1
2581,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"He may use light and colour, chiaroscuro and proportion as he pleases; he may borrow from any source he chooses; the only obligation upon him is to create an interesting design, expressive of the ideas inherent in the subject, and the various parts need bear no relationship to each other.",1
2582,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],The colour must be evocative and beautiful in itself.,1
2583,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"This work, traditionally entitled Joseph in Egypt, depicts the most significant episodes of Joseph reuniting with his family of origin.",1
2584,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],The painting is divided into four distinct zones.,1
2585,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"In the left foreground Joseph presents his family, who he invited to move to Egypt, to the pharaoh; according to Vasari, the boy with dark cloak and brown tunic sitting on the first step of the stairs on which the figures are arranged, is a portrait of the young Bronzino.",0
2586,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"On the right, Joseph is seen sitting on a triumphal cart pulled by three putti; hoisting himself up with his left arm and clutching firmly onto a putto with the other, he bends toward a kneeling figure who is presenting him a petition or reading him a message; a fifth putto, wrapped in a piece of cloth blown by the wind, dominates the scene from the top of a column, appearing to mime the gesture of one of the two half-living statues represented in the top left and centre of the painting.",0
2587,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"A restless crowd, curious to see what is going on, throngs the adjacent space between the two buildings in the background.",0
2588,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"Other mysterious figures, resting against one of the large boulders that dominate the landscape, turn their attention toward the action in the foreground.",0
2589,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"The clothes, expressions and features of all these figures are inspired by northern European painting, as is the large castle and surrounding trees depicted in the background.",0
2590,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"On the unrailed staircase of the imposing cylindrical building to the right, Joseph takes one of his children by the hand; higher up, the other is greeted affectionately by his mother.",0
2591,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],"Lastly, Joseph and his sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, are portrayed inside the room at the top of the building, where Jacob, now old and near to death, imparts his paternal blessing.",0
2592,['31940-03josep3.jpg'],The curious combination of all these elements confers to the painting an anomalous and intriguing quality,1
2593,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],"This painting, formerly given to Pomarancio, has been reattributed to Simon Vouet.",1
2594,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],It may perhaps be identifiable with the Magdalene cited with an attribution to Sacchi in the 1648-49 inventory of the Palazzo Barberini at Monterotondo.,1
2595,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],"The painting, which shows some stylistic and typological connections with the Vouet's David in Palazzo Bianco in Genoa, could date from the years (c. 1623-27) in which the French artist was in close contact with the Barberini, ending with his departure for France.",1
2596,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],"Though the canvas is certainly rich in Caravaggesque qualities, Vouet is already showing himself as a full participant in the new classicism that was on the rise in the Roman art scene.",1
2597,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],At the same time he also shows signs of sympathy with the first fully baroque works that were being created in Rome.,1
2598,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],"This painting poses interesting problems on account of its close compositional connections to the Magdalene by Guido Reni, dated to 1631-32 (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome).",1
2599,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],"The cut of the scene anticipates the composition that Vouet adopted for his Portrait of Gaucher de Chatillon (Louvre, Paris), carried out for the Palace of Cardinal Richelieu between 1633 and 1634.",1
2600,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],"Dominated by the monumental figure of the Magdalene, the picture opens out to a luxuriant perspectival landscape view in the left background.",0
2601,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],"Another highly interesting element is the close stylistic analogy between the Magdalene and Vouet's Allegory of Peace, that was also in the Barberini collection (also in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome).",1
2602,['43591-9marymag.jpg'],"As the Allegory has been attributed to an anonymous brother of the Cavalier Muti (a student of Vouet and Claude Mellan), the similarities between the two pictures lead to basic questions about the true authorship of this extraordinary painting",1
2603,['26364-corsini.jpg'],The picture shows the ceiling fresco in the reading room of the library of the Accademia dei Lincei in the Palazzo Corsini.,0
2604,['26364-corsini.jpg'],The shape of the frame alludes to Pietro da Cortona's ceiling in Santa Maria in Vallicella.,1
2605,['26364-corsini.jpg'],"This frame, especially characteristic of Rome, was popular both in sacred and secular contexts, and was also frequently used in horizontal-format compositions.",1
2606,['26364-corsini.jpg'],"The ceiling in the library of Palazzo Corsini, painted by the Florentine Vincenzo Meucci, is a good example.",1
2607,['26364-corsini.jpg'],"Befitting the stature of the Corsini family, which supplied a pope in Clement XII, the pictorial program combines motifs alluding to the function of the library (church fathers and scholars) with the personification of Ecclesia, angels, putti, virtues, and vanquished vices",1
2608,['36584-port_man.jpg'],This painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1833,1
2609,['38938-02gesuat.jpg'],"The fresco is the largest version of this subject in European art, and it combines two different iconographic traditions: in the upper part of the picture, the Rosenkranzbild, in which Mary gives the Rosary to mankind, and, in the lower part, a depiction of the beneficence of the Rosary on earth, represented by St Dominic.",1
2610,['38938-02gesuat.jpg'],"As well as the Madonna of the Rosary, the fresco also extols St Dominic, the founder of the Dominican order, to whom the dog is a reference (lat.",1

2616,['21312-03sebast.jpg'],"Most of the versions are curiously incompetent, only three of them having pretensions to quality.",1
2617,['21312-03sebast.jpg'],The upright versions of the same subject (one in the Louvre and the other in Berlin) are more celebrated.,1

2619,['21312-03sebast.jpg'],"The Louvre composition is especially moving, with the mourning figure in a blue cowl (in the Berlin version the cowl is black) looking as if she were taken from a piece of Burgundian tomb sculpture.",0
2620,['21312-03sebast.jpg'],Recent observations on the possible dating of the costumes have left little doubt that the picture is rather later than the artist's lifetime.,1
2621,['21312-03sebast.jpg'],"�tienne de La Tour, the son of the artist was suggested (but not accepted) as the possible author.",1
2622,['21312-03sebast.jpg'],"�tienne de La Tour is actually documented as being required to continue his father's style, should the latter die inopportunately, and it is likely that he continued long into the 1660s and even the 1670s, painting ever-weaker versions of his father's work which eventually became mockeries of his father's genius",1

2628,['30613-2mira11.jpg'],"This may be the fault of the faux architecture, which is rather cumbersome, out of proportion",1
2629,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"The Triumph of Pan was one of several paintings commissioned from Poussin, in 1636 the leading French artist in Rome, by Cardinal Richelieu.",1
2630,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"They were intended for a room in his ch&#226;teau in Poitou which would also house mythological pictures by Mantegna, Perugino and Costa.",1
2631,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"Poussin must have been advised about the scale not only of the canvases but also of the figures, for although he never saw the Renaissance paintings his personages are much the same size as theirs.",1
2632,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"He must also have been told that the pictures were to be set above a high dado, divided by gilt caryatids, gold fleur-de-lys against a blue ground, and marine battles, all under a gilt ceiling.",0
2633,['32256-08triump.jpg'],The Cabinet de la Chambre du Roy in Richelieu's ch&#226;teau celebrated the cardinal's 'gift' to Louis XIII of mastery of the seas.,1
2634,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"The room, with its 'Combat of Wealth and Art', as a contemporary panegyric puts it, and furnished in addition to paintings and panelling with porphyry vases and ancient busts, must have presented a formidable challenge to Poussin.",0
2635,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"Not only would he be competing with some of the foremost Italian Renaissance artists, his pictures also had to contend with the glittering d�cor - hence the colours here are among the most brilliant he ever lavished on a painting.",1
2636,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"Sadly, the room was dismantled long ago and the pictures dispersed, so we can judge the full effect only in our mind's eye.",1
2637,['32256-08triump.jpg'],Poussin carefully allowed for the spectator's point of view.,1
2638,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"Nimble visitors to the Gallery can sit on the floor to look at this picture in order better to appreciate its spatial construction, and thus its full significance.",1

2640,['32256-08triump.jpg'],Propped up vertically against this earthen stage are a timbrel and two masks - an ancient satyr mask and a modern Italian Columbine.,0
2641,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"Behind them a Punchinello mask joins a still life drawn from the imagery of ancient bacchanals: thyrsoi - staffs wreathed with ivy and surmounted by pine cones - the crooked stick and pipes of Pan, wine in a metal bowl or crater, and a Greek wine jar showing the god Dionysus, the Roman Bacchus.",0
2642,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"The composition is indebted to an engraving after Giulio Romano, a pupil of Raphael, but Poussin also demonstrates his first-hand access to antiquarian lore.",1
2643,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"The mixture of modern and ancient masks, and the stage-like construction, allude to the origins of theatre in bacchic rites.",1
2644,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"The main scene represents the 'triumph' or worship of the armless bust of a horned deity mounted on a pillar, his face smeared red with the juice of boiled ivy stems.",0
2645,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"This is the 'term' of Pan, Arcadian god of shepherds and herdsmen, and Priapus, a phallic god of fertility, protector of gardens, whose cult was imported into Greece from the Near East.",1
2646,['32256-08triump.jpg'],"Confused with each other, both were associated with Dionysus/Bacchus: Dionysus, god of the grape-vine, who died, descended into Hades then rose again was himself identified with seasonal decay and rebirth.",1
2647,['32256-08triump.jpg'],All the participants are members of his entourage (as we find them in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne): nymphs and their lewd playmates the satyrs; maenads who rend deer limb from limb or strew flowers from the winnowing basket sacred to Dionysus.,0

2659,['04499-holyfami.jpg'],"Unlike his master's fluid, near academic reading of Michelangelo's style, Giovan Francesco Bezzi (Nosadella) invested his figures with an exaggerated, almost grotesque monumentality and placed them within a relationship of congested intimacy",1

2735,['13335-1open.jpg'],The verse was placed there when the altarpiece was installed on 6 May 1432.The stylistic analysis reveals that in the painting the work of two different hands can be clearly discerned.,1
2736,['13335-1open.jpg'],"The overall conception of the altarpiece is the work of Hubert, along with the execution of certain parts, such as the panels in the lower tier.",1
2737,['13335-1open.jpg'],"Here, the manner is archaic, and reflects the continuing dominance of the international style that was practised by Broederlam.",1
2738,['13335-1open.jpg'],"The composition is typically unoriginal: the landscape is still conceived as a distant background, with which the figures at the front have no organic relation, an effect that is reinforced by the bird's eye point of view.",0
2739,['13335-1open.jpg'],"This polyptych is mystical, not to say esoteric, in intention, and is imbued throughout with both spiritual and intellectual signification.",1

2801,['16367-wall.jpg'],"The Old Testament scenes are of a very modest standard, and owe their presence in the chapel to the Gothic tradition of representing parallels between the Old and New Testament.",1

2820,['39646-4vendra.jpg'],"Titian adapted elements such as the steps, massive altar and flickering candles from Raphael's Mass of Bolsena as a suitably impressive setting for the Vendramin family's adoration of a reliquary of a fragment of the True Cross.",1
2821,['39646-4vendra.jpg'],"Although the relic was owned by the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, the Vendramin family was closely associated with it: one of their ancestors had donated the relic to the Scuola, and an Andrea Vendramin, namesake of Titian's patron, was famous for having rescued it when it fell into a canal.",1
2822,['39646-4vendra.jpg'],"Titian suggests the intimacy of the family's relation to the relic by placing the current head of family (also named Andrea) in the centre of the composition, with one hand on the altar as he looks out of the picture, inviting the viewer's participation.",1

3312,['18765-guard307.jpg'],"However, a comparison with this source makes it clear that Guardi, despite the strong perspectival arrangement of this composition, neither subjected the cityscape to a strict perspectival system nor strove for an exact, detailed rendering of the architecture.",1

3457,['26023-13john.jpg'],"The composition of the triptych as a whole is not only ingenious in narrative terms, with the different components interlocking spatially and thematically; it is also new in many respects as far as the portrayal of the Virgin Mary in heaven and the Apocalypse are concerned.",1
3458,['26023-13john.jpg'],The iconographical forebears of such a grouping of saints sitting and standing around an enthroned Virgin are few and far between.,0

3475,['26023-13john.jpg'],"Given that these are evidently intended as portraits, the altarpiece must have been ordered before the death of Antheunis Seghers in 1475, which means that its production may logically be linked with the expansion of the chapel's apse in 1473- 74 though we lack details of Jacob de Ceuninc and Clara van Hulsen in those years.",1
3476,['26023-13john.jpg'],"The altarpiece is, of course, dedicated to the patron saints of St John's Hospital.",1
3477,['26023-13john.jpg'],The central portrayal of the Virgin might relate to the hospital chapel's long-standing and close links with the chapter of the almost adjacent Church of Our Lady.,0

3479,['26023-13john.jpg'],Their presence in the hospital context has frequently been explained in terms of their symbolising respectively the contemplative and active life of the hospital's monastic community,1
3480,['26290-boy_draw.jpg'],Mercier is credited with bringing the French style of genre and conversation painting to England.,1

3500,['40370-2battle.jpg'],Uccello's obsession with displaying his mastery of perspective (such as the long white and red lances or the exceptional horses that have rolled over on the ground) and the dramatic nature of the clash between the knights combine with his almost magical story telling.,0
3501,['40370-2battle.jpg'],This is underpinned by the use of unreal colours and light as if describing some fabulous tale of chivalrous adventure,1
3502,['20127-anaemic.jpg'],"Van Hoogstraten's most concentrated period of genre painting production occurred only during the last years of his career, around 1670&#151;71.",1

3505,['20127-anaemic.jpg'],In the Anaemic Lady a taciturn physician examines a flask containing the urine of an ailing young woman while another man (her husband?) looks on.,0
3506,['20127-anaemic.jpg'],This event takes place in a well-appointed house; the recession of space through two rooms in the background allows the viewer to scrutinize some very interesting paintings hanging on the walls and a sliver of a brilliantly illuminated gilt-leather wall-hanging.,0
3507,['20127-anaemic.jpg'],"The inclusion of gilt-leather wall-hangings (an expensive decorative accouterment at this time), costly paintings, and sumptuous fabrics enhances the aura of opulence exuded by the painting",1
3508,['11211-1890s_06.jpg'],After 1880 Degas also explored the theme of women bathing.,1

3749,['19658-campovac.jpg'],This impressive view of the Roman Forum is a rare topographical representation of the city by the artist.,1
3750,['19658-campovac.jpg'],The painter's lively combination of contemporary figures in a topographically accurate setting was typical of the type of views of the city eagerly sought by both Italian collectors and visiting Grand Tourists.,1
3751,['19658-campovac.jpg'],"Here de Heusch depicts the busy daily life of the Roman Forum, known as the 'Campo Vaccino' since the end of the sixteenth century due to the herds of cows that grazed there.",0

3759,['35015-pieta.jpg'],"It is already clear in this, his first definitely dated work, that Girolamo Romanino, like Lotto and Savoldo, was reluctant to enter fully into the tradition of Venetian figurative art.",1
3760,['35015-pieta.jpg'],"The panel was painted for the Chapel of the Holy Passion in the old church of San Lorenzo in Brescia and in it we can see Romanino's predilection for Titian's sonorously rich colour transposed onto a plane of popular narrative strengthened by a romantic, imaginative pathos.",1
3761,['35015-pieta.jpg'],"Against the background of a landscape which itself seems constricted in its atmosphere of profound anguish, the figures of the foreground seem to float to the surface in sharply cadenced groupings painted in timbres of a blazing quality.",0
3762,['35015-pieta.jpg'],"The influence of Lombard style which can be noted in the roundish faces painted after the fashion of Bramante, are accompanied by the influence of Northern European painting which can be seen in the view of the town glimpsed through the steamy, stormy atmosphere, in the objective quality of the portrait of the man, in the expressionistic deformation of the little human figures moving around the crosses at Golgotha.",1
3763,['35015-pieta.jpg'],"In this earliest attributable work by Romanino, the characteristic quality of the artist's style is already evident: an expressionistic realism which seems to offer an extremely personalized reflection of the political, social and religious crises that shook the Western world in the first half of the sixteenth century",1
3764,['09907-courb411.jpg'],"Courbet's marine scenes were often painted at �tretat, a Norman fishing village popular among artists of his generation and, later, the Impressionists.",1

3766,['09907-courb411.jpg'],Courbet painted many views of this site in the late 1860s and early 1870s.,1
3767,['09907-courb411.jpg'],"This painting stress a rock formation known as Aval or Aiouille, where a natural flying buttress appears to support an equally natural, crenellated tower.",0
3768,['09907-courb411.jpg'],This sense of implicit architecture suggests a great city lost in primeval times,1
3769,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"The painting is a portable triptych of a type that was fairly widely produced in Italy during the early fourteenth century, essentially for private worship.",1
3770,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],For the purposes of travel the wings would have closed inwards covering the centre panels and lying flush with the raised spandrel above the inner moulding.,1
3771,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"The backs of the wings were most probably painted with imitation marble or porphyry, perhaps with decorative motifs, as opposed to narrative scenes.",1
3772,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],The creation of a work of art of this kind was due to a combination of craftsmanship and painterly skills.,1
3773,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],Some of the finest surviving examples are Florentine or Sienese in origin.,1
3774,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"The triptych in the Royal Collection is comparable with examples in the National Gallery in London, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Pinacoteca in Siena, and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts, all of which, according to varying degrees of attribution, are associated with Duccio or his workshop.",1
3775,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"The exact attribution of the present triptych is unsettled owing to the multiplicity of hands at work not only in Duccio's workshop as a whole, but even on the surface of individual paintings.",1
3776,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],The centre panel in particular is of a quality worthy of Duccio himself.,0
3777,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"The same might almost be said of the lower scenes in each of the wings, certainly in their design even if the actual execution reveals evidence of assistants (for example, the gold decoration on the cloth of honour behind Christ and the Virgin Enthroned, lower right).",1
3778,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"The inconsistencies apparent in the architecture of Annunciation (top left) or the design of the two thrones are not unknown in Duccio's own work, as revealed in the Maest&#224; of 1308-11 (Siena, Museo dell'Opera del Duomo) with which this triptych is comparable in date or possibly slightly earlier.",1
3779,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],The iconography of the panels is also significant.,1
3780,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"Paradoxically, the inner religious consistency is derived from the unusual combination of scenes, especially the pairing of enthroned figures in the lower sections of the wings.",1
3781,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"The enthronement of the Virgin twice (lower left and lower right), for instance, suggests a temporal sequence before and after Christ's death as represented in the centre.",1
3782,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"The Annunciation (top left) is comparable with the relevant scene (now in the National Gallery, London) from the Maest&#224;, whereas both Saint Francis receiving the Stigmata (top right) and Christ and the Virgin Enthroned (lower right) recall frescoes in the Upper Church of St Francis, Assisi (the former in the nave from the Life of Saint Francis and the latter, earlier in date and by Cimabue, in the transept).",1
3783,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"These connotations and the treatment of the crucifixion in a devotional, as opposed to a narrative sense, imply a Franciscan origin for this triptych.",1
3784,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],The quantity of blood depicted in the central scene (some of it removed in an earlier restoration) is an unusual feature in a work on this scale.,1
3785,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"Probably before it became part of the Royal Collection the triptych had been dismantled and put in a heavy gothic frame, which was removed when it was cleaned in 1930.",1
3786,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],After this the triptych was displayed in a shadow box with a simpler frame.,1
3787,['12322-8windsor.jpg'],"This, too, was considered to be inappropriate and the present reconstruction of the triptych was devised in 1988, although further thought has since been given to the angle at which the two wings should be positioned in order to make proper visual sense of the architecture.",1
3788,['00948-01grapes.jpg'],This panel was inspired by the Madonna and Child with Saint Anne by Masaccio and Masolino,1
3789,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"This panel formed part of a predella, which included a Visitation (Courtauld Galleries, London), a Nativity (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), an Adoration of the Magi (Courtauld Galleries, London), and a Flight into Egypt (Lindenau-Museum, Altenburg).The oblong frame, with a semicircle on every corner and angular projections between them, divides the picture into three parts and Lorenzo Monaco made good use of the possibilities offered by the unusual shape of the frame.",1
3790,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"He placed the Virgin and her Child-isolated from the other figures-into the central, widest part.",0
3791,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"The Virgin is riding the ass side-saddle, as though she were sitting on a throne, and she is turned towards us.",0
3792,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"To indicate the direction of her course, her body is a little bent backwards.",0
3793,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"The oblique line of her body suggests a straight line between the upper point of the frame and the bottom inward angle on the right, and this diagonal axis is further stressed by the ass's foreleg, stepping forwards, which, continuing the same line, eventually ends in the semicircle.",0
3794,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],A similar connection between the composition and the frame can be observed in the hindmost leg of the ass and the bottom left semicircle.,1
3795,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],The oblique line of the leg is a reflected image of the axis which was mentioned previously.,0
3796,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"The horizontal line of the animal's body links the figures of the Virgin and Joseph, and, at the same time, it separates the Holy Family from the women accompanying them.",0
3797,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"The palm branches in the hands of the woman in a green cloak, and the drapery falling downwards from her arm, practically creates a line between the top and the bottom angular indentations of the frame.",0
3798,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],(According to some apocryphal gospels the fleeing Holy Family was nourished by the fruits of a palm-tree bending towards them.),1
3799,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"The background, too, separates the left-hand side of the picture from the rest: the escorts proceed among bare, grey rocks, while the Holy Family move through woods: the foliage magically illuminates the semi-darkness.",0
3800,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"Whilst the two female figures are moving forwards, Joseph, at the head of the small group, has stopped and looks back.",0
3801,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],By this the painting representing progress in one direction becomes enclosed and symmetrical.,1
3802,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"This geometrically constructed composition with its strict rhythm by Lorenzo Monaco shows, as do all his works, that even while pursuing the best trecento traditions of Florentine art, an artist could adjust himself to the International Gothic style.",1
3803,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"Counterparts of the two women, with the long, even and soft folds of their draperies, or of the Virgin's graceful, aristocratic figure, could be found anywhere in the art of the period.",0
3804,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],"On the other hand, the vigorous and definite personality of Joseph can be imagined only in Florentine art, which had old, democratic traditions.",1
3805,['23175-13monaco.jpg'],In vain would we try to find this image in the representations of Joseph as the humble old man in Northern art,1
3806,['15209-david.jpg'],Orazio Gentileschi's brooding image of David contemplating the head of Goliath reflects a new type of meditative image introduced at the beginning of the seventeenth century by Caravaggio.,1
3807,['15209-david.jpg'],Traditionally David was shown either as an uncompromised biblical hero slaying Goliath or as a triumphant youth displaying the giant's decapitated head.,0
3808,['15209-david.jpg'],"In Caravaggio's David with the Head of Goliath (Galleria Borghese, Rome), which was likely to have been sent from Naples around 1609 as a gift for Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the adolescent hero gazes tenderly at his victim's head, creating a strong, almost erotic, bond.",1
3809,['15209-david.jpg'],"Orazio's David does not interact with Goliath's head, rather he stands beside it lost in a moment of deep introspection, evoking a pensive atmosphere similar to the mood generated in Caravaggio's St John the Baptist.",1
3810,['15209-david.jpg'],"Like the St John, David's body is pushed towards the picture plane and set off against a background of dense, dark foliage.",0
3811,['15209-david.jpg'],"This verdant background is strikingly different from the one in Orazio's small copper version (Gem&#228;ldegalerie, Berlin), in which David is framed by a rocky cliff.",1
3812,['15209-david.jpg'],"The difference has led some critics to suggest that Agostino Tassi was responsible for the landscape in the Spada picture, but there is no conclusive proof to substantiate this.",1
3813,['15209-david.jpg'],"Unlike the Berlin copper, where David is seen full-length, in the Spada version his body is cropped just below the knee and Goliath's head is turned upwards towards the viewer.",1
3814,['15209-david.jpg'],It has been suggested that the Spada canvas was cut down at the bottom.,1
3815,['15209-david.jpg'],"However, technical evidence shows that instead it was extended on all four sides.",1
3816,['15209-david.jpg'],Thus the picture would have focused more directly on the contemplative and melancholic David and the head of Goliath would have appeared to rest on the edge of the frame.,1
3817,['15209-david.jpg'],"A copy of the Berlin composition (Quadreria Arcivescovile, Milan) was paired with a version of Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith Beheading Holofernes , but there is no evidence to indicate that two pictures of such contrasting moods were originally conceived as pendants.",1

3868,['11390-kitchen.jpg'],The painting is chiefly an exercise in depicting metallic surfaces and effects of reflected light and was probably intended to hang in the kitchen of a substantial household,1
3869,['02791-stillif5.jpg'],"This still-life, unlike van der Ast's early ones, the arrangement of the still-life looks quite natural, as if the artist simply portraying a basket that he had filled with fresh flowers in his studio.",1

3888,['08992-07italia.jpg'],It was only in his thirties that he began to acquire stature and reputation as an artist in his own right.,1
3889,['08992-07italia.jpg'],"The German painter-biographer Joachim von Sandrart, reporting on his visit to Rome (1629-35), writes that Claude was determined 'to become familiar with nature in all its forms, and would spend whole days and late into the night in the fields, so that he learned how to convey most naturally the flush of day, the rising and setting of the sun . . .'.",1
3890,['08992-07italia.jpg'],Characteristic features of Claude's art are the subtle moods of the landscape and the variation in the seascape with the changing seasons.,1
3891,['08992-07italia.jpg'],People are unimportant in his pictures; the painter regarded them only as a means of lending animation to his landscapes and as a rule he did not even paint them himself.,0
3892,['08992-07italia.jpg'],"In the 1630s he started a book which he gradually filled with pen-and-ink drawings of almost 200 of his own pictures; although it does not comprise his entire oeuvre, it is nevertheless a unique documentary record of his artistic creations.",1

3904,['09602-day.jpg'],It can be considered as the companion of the Nativity (The Night) in Dresden.,1
3905,['09602-day.jpg'],"Considered his masterpiece among the altarpieces, the composition is built up as a remote variation of the pyramidal arrangements favoured by Leonardo, broken by the dominating verticality of St Jerome on the left.",1

3924,['26005-02last4.jpg'],"The coats-of-arms were originally reversed - in other words, the man's arms appeared in the woman's panel, and vice versa.",1
3925,['26005-02last4.jpg'],"Before departing for London in December 1467, Tani founded a chapel dedicated to St Michael at his employer's church in Fiesole and drew up his will.",1
3926,['26005-02last4.jpg'],He probably also made funeral arrangements in the customary manner.,1
3927,['26005-02last4.jpg'],"He will then have required an altarpiece, which he ordered from Memling some time after the end of 1467 during his stay in the north.",1
3928,['26005-02last4.jpg'],"The painting was, therefore, largely executed during his stay in London between 1467 and 1469, from where he could monitor its progress.",1
3929,['26005-02last4.jpg'],The iconography of the altarpiece is clarified by its destination.,1
3930,['26005-02last4.jpg'],"St Michael has been selected here first and foremost as the saint to whom the chapel was dedicated, and only in the second place as Tani's patron.",1
3931,['26005-02last4.jpg'],This also explains the absence of the woman's patron.,1
3932,['26005-02last4.jpg'],"Taken together, the grisailles depict the victory of St Michael over Satan, who was threatening the Virgin and Christ Child",0
3933,['05756-jephta.jpg'],"Jephthah was a great Old Testament (Judges 11:30-40) warrior, who was called upon to lead the Israelites in their war against the Ammonites.",1

3938,['09263-virgin_c.jpg'],Her inclusion in the present work perhaps indicates that the panel was commissioned by a patron from Chiusi.,1

3946,['10756-apocalyp.jpg'],The present painting is presumably one of four depicting scenes from the Apocalypse.,1
3947,['10756-apocalyp.jpg'],"In a Romantic nocturnal landscape evoking the infinity of the cosmos appears a vision of the giant angel described in Chapter 10 of the Apocalypse, descending in a cloud from heaven with a rainbow over his head and legs like columns of fire.",0
3948,['10756-apocalyp.jpg'],The natural scene in which the visionary apparition is set evinces a coloration and sophisticated painterly handling that explain Danby's rank as one of the finest British landscapists of the nineteenth century,1
3949,['32435-antioch.jpg'],This early painting by Preti is notable for its rare literary subject and clear stylistic allusion to Paolo Veronese.,1

4629,['38248-the_cook.jpg'],The scene as a whole can be considered a masterpiece of Italian genre painting.,1

4633,['35682-benthei.jpg'],"During the years from about 1650 to about 1655, the heroic quality of Ruisdael's landscapes increases.",1
4634,['35682-benthei.jpg'],The forms become larger and more massive.,1
4635,['35682-benthei.jpg'],Giant oaks and beeches as well as shrubs acquire an unprecedented abundance and fullness.,0
4636,['35682-benthei.jpg'],"Colours become more vivid, space increases in both height and depth, and there is an emphasis on the tectonic structure of the compositions.",1
4637,['35682-benthei.jpg'],He strove to achieve heroic effects without sacrificing the individuality of a single tree or bush.,1
4638,['35682-benthei.jpg'],An outstanding example of this tendency is his mighty view of Bentheim Castle.,1
4639,['35682-benthei.jpg'],"Ruisdael visited Bentheim, a small town in Wesphalia near the Dutch-German border, when he travelled to the region with his friend Berchem in the early fifties.",1
4640,['35682-benthei.jpg'],"Bentheim's castle is, in fact, on an unimposing low hill, but in his painting Ruisdael enlarged it into a wooded mountain providing the castle with a commanding position.",1
4641,['35682-benthei.jpg'],His invention is a superb expression of his aggrandizement of solid forms during this phase.,1
4642,['35682-benthei.jpg'],"The dense mass of the mountain, obliquely stretching away into depth, and the coulisses on either side of the front edge of the painting are reminiscent of compositional schemes used by the generation of his teachers, but the spatial clarity is new, as are the strong colours, the energy of the brushwork, and the way he unifies the close view of a nearly overwhelming wealth of detail with the most distant parts of the landscape into a consistent whole.",0
4643,['35682-benthei.jpg'],The impact of the broad prospect is as intense as the vegetation seen close up.,1

4648,['33600-05group.jpg'],"The original title, recorded in the still extant family chronicle of Captain Banning Cocq, together with a sketch of the painting, sounds rather dry by comparison: ""Sketch of the painting from the Great Hall of Cleveniers Doelen, in which the young Heer van Purmerlandt [Banning Cocq], as captain, orders his lieutenant, the Heer van Vlaerderdingen [Willem van Ruytenburch], to march the company out.",1

4650,['33600-05group.jpg'],What sets Rembrandt's group portrait apart from other comparable paintings is his use of chiaroscuro as a dramatic device.,1
