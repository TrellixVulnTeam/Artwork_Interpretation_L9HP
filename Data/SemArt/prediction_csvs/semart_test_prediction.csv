0,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"Of the Hungarian kings St Ladislas is perhaps the one most often represented in post-medieval frescoes, altar paintings and statues.",1
1,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],In the Middle Ages he was associated with the ideal of chivalry and the legends which gathered around him determined the manner of his representation.,1
2,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"Thus the knightly armour and the battle-axe have become permanent attributes, in addition to the crown and the orb.",0
3,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"The painting illustrated here, dating from the late sixteenth century, is only superficially linked with medieval portraits of St. Ladislas.",1
4,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"The king is shown seated on a throne wearing an ample, richly embroidered cloak studded with pearls round the hem.",0
5,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"In the foreground is a voluted and foiled shield with the national emblem, stylized in harmony with the throne.",0
6,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],The background is designed to suggest the interior of a Renaissance palace.,0
7,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],Through opening on either side of the wall behind the throne - draped with embroidered hangings - there is a view of landscape.,0
8,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],A similar motif was often used to fill in the background in north Italian Madonna paintings of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.,1
9,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"The monochrome landscape on the left is a topographic reference to one of St. Ladislas' most important church activities, the foundation of the Cathedral in Nagyv�rad, while the one on the right shows his legendary defeat of the Cumanian abductor.",0
10,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"This evocation of two popular episodes from the story of the king's life is intended partly to identify St. Ladislas as a rule of worldly power, and partly to indicate the ideal unity of the Christian king and the Christian knight.",1
11,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"St Ladislas is shown as a historical personage, without a halo - a fact indicating that the painting was destined for a secular building.",0
12,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],"The episodes from the king's life or, to be mere accurate, from legends associated with his name, are treated as historical facts.",1
13,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],The same approach characterized the series of prints of royalty and other notabilities which became so popular all Europe in the course of the sixteenth century.,1
14,['41294-10ladisl.jpg'],It may be assumed that such prints served as models for the painted portrait of St. Ladislas and the two related pictures of St. Stephen and St Emeric,1
15,['42791-1sacris.jpg'],This ceiling painting in the sacristy of San Sebastiano has an unusual iconography compared with older depictions.,1
16,['42791-1sacris.jpg'],"Mary is being crowned by Christ, while God the Father touches His Son's shoulder with his left hand.",0
17,['42791-1sacris.jpg'],The date of completion of the ceiling painting is recorded in a book in one of the four corner tondos held by a winged angel.,1
18,['42791-1sacris.jpg'],"The inscription reads: M.D.L.V./ DIE XXIII/ NOVEMBER (November 23, 1555)",1
19,['14376-worship.jpg'],"In the same period when the most talented artists in the country had gathered around Rubens in Antwerp, there were also other artists working in Antwerp who still clung to the taste of Rubens' predecessors.",1
20,['14376-worship.jpg'],"One of these was Frans II Francken, who painted Rockox's 'constcamer'.",1
21,['14376-worship.jpg'],"He was a very popular artist in his time, and although he lacked any outstanding imaginative power or great technical skill, his fame rests on his ability to convert monumental subjects from large-scale art works to proportions more suitable for private houses.",1
22,['14376-worship.jpg'],The Worship of the Golden Calf is a typical example of the many religious and mythological scenes,1
23,['14376-worship.jpg'],he painted,1
24,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],Based on its style the Annunciation is attributed to the Master of Fl�malle and dated between c. 1415 and 1425.,1
25,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"The painter's provisional name refers to the ""Abbey of Fl�malle"" where certain of his works are assumed to have been painted.",1
26,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"However, in this village near Li�ge there was never any abbey.",1
27,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],Today the master is commonly identified with the Tournai artist Robert Campin.,1
28,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"The scene takes place inside a bourgeois dwelling, a novelty in the painting of the time, as until then the scene had always been depicted in or in front of a church.",0
29,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"In line with tradition, Gabriel enters the room from the left.",1
30,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"The Virgin is seated in front of a low bench on the tiled floor, a sign of her humility.",0
31,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"The edge of her mantle is decorated with an inscription, another innovation of the Master of Fl�malle.",0
32,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],Its text appears to be inspired by the popular medieval Marian hymn Salve Regina.,1
33,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],The Virgin's gestures illustrate her acceptance.,1
34,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"Her right hand rests on her breast, her eyes modestly cast downwards.",0
35,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"On Mary's lap is an open book, a second one lies on the table.",0
36,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"This motif is possibly taken from devotional tracts of around 1400, which state that the Virgin was meditating on the Holy Scriptures when Gabriel entered.",1
37,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],The books also indicate her as the possessor of divine wisdom.,1
38,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"In this connection, the bench is decorated with little lions, as was once the throne of Solomon, the Old Testament king who used to be seen as the epitome of wisdom.",0
39,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],The stained glass figures possibly represent prophets who foretold the coming of the Messiah.,0
40,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"Other apparently everyday objects also have an additional, deeper significance.",1
41,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"The hand broom next to the chimney symbolises the purification from the stain of sin, and the white lilies in the maiolica vase Mary's virginity.",0
42,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"The open window probably alludes to her honorary title as 'fenestra coeli', the window of heaven.",0
43,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],The candles and their holders refer to Christ and the Virgin.,0
44,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],The fact that the candles are snuffed out indicates that conception has already taken place.,1
45,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"One intriguing detail is the woodcut above the chimney, depicting St Christopher carrying the Child across the river.",0
46,['24776-annuncia.jpg'],"This motif is a good illustration of the chronological jumps frequently found in the paintings of Flemish Primitives, as according to the main scene, depicting the Annunciation, the Saviour has not even been born",1
47,['23845-3manet04.jpg'],"The 1870s were rich in female models for Manet: the Brunette with Bare Breasts, the Blonde with Bare Breasts and the Sultana testify to it",1
48,['07338-st-john.jpg'],"This painting, contracted on 23 November 1635, was executed for the convent church of Santa Paula in Seville.",1
49,['07338-st-john.jpg'],It is evident that the artist had mastered an Italianate manner of painting; the figure of the angel alone is sufficient to corroborate this observation.,1
50,['07338-st-john.jpg'],"The partly clad body, the complicated, foreshortened pose, and the mastery of anatomical drawing are unique elements in Sevillian painting of the time, as are the deep perspective of the landscape and the delicate, translucent colours.",0
51,['07338-st-john.jpg'],"Cano's mastery of this facile, sophisticated style suggests that he had passed time in Italy, although there is not the slightest evidence that he left the city until his final departure in 1638",1
52,['07082-virginch.jpg'],"The stylistic characteristics of this painting, such as rounded faces and narrow, elongated eyes seem to be a general reflection of the foreign presence in Genoese painting at this time",1
53,['24464-pisa_pr1.jpg'],"This painting is the central predella panel of the Pisa Altarpiece, directly beneath the enthroned Madonna and Child.",1
54,['24464-pisa_pr1.jpg'],"Compared to Gentile da Fabriano's painting of the same subject done in Florence just a few years before, Masaccio's treatment is entirely new.",1
55,['24464-pisa_pr1.jpg'],"Besides offering lifelike portraits of the patron and his nephew in contemporary dress at the middle right, he has given the entire scene a convincing atmosphere which surrounds the figures and the landscape.",0
56,['24464-pisa_pr1.jpg'],"In the distance, the atmosphere breaks down the clarity of the forms resulting in an effect which is referred to as aerial perspective",0
57,['30789-galitzip.jpg'],The picture shows the central panel of the triptych representing Christ on the Cross between the Virgin and St John the Evangelist,0
58,['31921-stillif1.jpg'],"The large dark vine leaves and fruit are back-lit and are sharply silhouetted against the luminous background, to quite dramatic effect.",0
59,['31921-stillif1.jpg'],"Ponce's use of this effect strongly indicates the indirect influence of Caravaggio's Basket of Fruit in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, Milan, almost 50 years after it was created",1
60,['16988-nuenen03.jpg'],"Catalogue numbers: F 30, JH 479.In Nuenen between January and August 1884, van Gogh depicted the figure of the weaver working at the loom in several pen drawings, watercolours and oil paintings.",1
61,['16988-nuenen03.jpg'],"In this small village of Northern-Brabant, to where his parents moved in September 1882, more than four hundred people took up weaving, an activity of domestic industry during the winter months, when agricultural labour was suspended.",1
62,['16988-nuenen03.jpg'],The chronology of the series could be determined by the development in representing the loom.,1
63,['16988-nuenen03.jpg'],"As time went by, van Gogh depicted the loom with more and more precision, abandoning the anecdotal elements and concentrating on the work process and on the machine itself",1
64,['21562-abraham.jpg'],The painting is signed and dated on the rock at the left side,1
65,['23235-predell1.jpg'],Lorenzo Veneziano fulfilled countless commissions in Venice and its vicinity that display a handsome fusion of Byzantine and later pictorial currents.,1
66,['23235-predell1.jpg'],His commissions included that for an altarpiece which was later dismembered.,1
67,['23235-predell1.jpg'],"The central panel depicting Christ Giving the Keys to St Peter is now in the Museo Correr, Venice, the side panels were destroyed in Berlin in 1945.",0
68,['23235-predell1.jpg'],"The five predella panels survived, they comprise the Conversion of Paul; the Calling of the Apostles Peter and Andrew; the Christ Rescuing Peter from Drowning; the Apostle Peter Preaching;",1
69,['23235-predell1.jpg'],the Crucifixion of Peter,1
70,['10416-19melanc.jpg'],"Philipp Melanchthon (1497-1560) was a German reformer, collaborator with Martin Luther, the first systematic theologian of the Protestant Reformation, intellectual leader of the Lutheran Reformation, and an influential designer of educational systems.",1
71,['10416-19melanc.jpg'],"He stands next to Luther and Calvin as a reformer, theologian, and molder of Protestantism.",0
72,['10416-19melanc.jpg'],"Melanchthon had his portrait painted on numerous occasions, but he only sat to four artists: Albrecht D�rer (in an engraving of 1526); Hans Holbein the Younger (whose portrait of circa 1535 is in the Nieders&#228;chsisches Landesmuseums, Hannover); and both Lucas Cranach the Elder and his son Lucas Cranach the Younger.",1
73,['10416-19melanc.jpg'],"Cranach the Younger painted several portraits of Melanchthon, probably from the mid 1540s onwards.",1
74,['10416-19melanc.jpg'],"The earliest would seem to be that dated 1544, in �stra Ryd, Sweden, and the last painted from life is that signed and dated 1559 in the St&#228;del Museum, Frankfurt am Main, finished just one year before Melanchthon's death at the age of 63.",1
75,['10416-19melanc.jpg'],Such was the demand for portraits of Luther and Melanchthon that several posthumous works were produced by Cranach the Younger and his studio,1
76,['41688-02madchr.jpg'],The picture shows the central panel of the triptych of the Cathedral in Seville.,0
77,['41688-02madchr.jpg'],The altarpiece is related to Sienese painting.,1
78,['41688-02madchr.jpg'],The artist is referred to as Juan de Sevilla,1
79,['18525-2summer1.jpg'],Abel Grimmer continued the themes of Pieter Bruegel the Elder and evoked the four seasons in many of his paintings.,1
80,['18525-2summer1.jpg'],He copied the subjects produced by Bruegel while adding his own mark: a stylisation of the forms and the introduction of powerful colours.,1
81,['18525-2summer1.jpg'],The present panel of Summer is an interpretation of the famous drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.,1
82,['18525-2summer1.jpg'],"This drawing inspired numerous artists including his son, Pieter Brueghel the Younger.",1
83,['18525-2summer1.jpg'],"Not all refer to the drawing itself, but rather to the engraving of it made by Pieter Cock around 1570.",1
84,['18525-2summer1.jpg'],Engraving flourished in Antwerp in the 16th century and was an excellent means of distribution.,1
85,['18525-2summer1.jpg'],"Hence, artists were familiar with the works of their contemporaries.",1
86,['18525-2summer1.jpg'],There are other versions of this painting by Abel Grimmer,1
87,['34296-sabine2.jpg'],The Rape of the Sabine Women and its companion-piece the Battle of the Romans and the Sabines illustrates the legend of Rome's foundation.,1
88,['34296-sabine2.jpg'],"Romulus, the founder of Rome, succeeded by a ruse in ensuring the future growth of the population.",1
89,['34296-sabine2.jpg'],"He arranged a festival to which were invited the inhabitants of neighbouring settlements including the Sabines, with their wives and children.",1
90,['34296-sabine2.jpg'],"During the festivities, at a given signal, the young men of Rome broke into the crowd and, choosing only unmarried maidens of the Sabines, carried them off.",1
91,['34296-sabine2.jpg'],The Sabine women accepted their lot.,1
92,['34296-sabine2.jpg'],But later a Sabine army attacked the city in force and succeeded in overcoming part of it.,1
93,['34296-sabine2.jpg'],They were prevented from going further by the intervention of the Sabine women which brought about peace between the warring soldiers.,1
94,['34296-sabine2.jpg'],"The glowing colours of the two paintings reveal the influence of Paolo Veronese, while the pastel illumination of Ricci's palette anticipates the Rococo",1
95,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"Francesco Guardi was a collaborator of Gianantonio, from whom he learned the craft of painting, but he introduced into his older brothers art his own profoundly meditative personality.",1
96,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"This fact is evinced by the essential differences to be discerned in the works the ""workshop"" produced.",1
97,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"This picture, unanimously attributed by researchers to Francesco, is, in all likelihood, the fragment of a larger composition.",1
98,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"The whole scene is summarized in the slow and calm movement of the gondoliere in the foreground, whereas the scenery of the lagoon virtually disintegrates in the mother-of-pearl atmosphere, which is lightened here and there by some rare flashes in the background.",0
99,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"The lonely gondola is seen in the lagoon at the Fondamente Nuove, in front of the islands of San Cristoforo and San Michele.",0
100,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"The emotional intensity of the painting is condensed into this brief recording of the moment, as if it were a ""phrase in music"", for example in Vivaldi's or Albinoni's compositions of the same theme.",1
101,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"The smooth lagoon and the ""adagio continuo"" are parallel motifs of picture and music.",1
102,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"The scenery becomes dissolved in musicality, as musicality disintegrates ""in sorrowful weeping"" (Goethe).The mournful character of the black gondola is both a forecast and a conscious experience of the future destiny of the world of lagoons &#151; a world enclosed within its own modest boundaries.",1
103,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"This is a world which has disappeared, because it was linked to a declining civilization.",1
104,['18753-guard219.jpg'],"The argument was not continued, and it has not been taken up again; the other lagoon painters, such as the members of the Burano school, could not disguise the emptiness &#151; not only of form but also of content.",1
105,['28665-1london3.jpg'],This canvas belongs to a series of eleven paintings executed after Monet's stays in London.,1
106,['28665-1london3.jpg'],The Parliament building is viewed from a window of St. Thomas's Hospital located on the opposite shore of the Thames.,0
107,['28665-1london3.jpg'],"During his four visits to London between 1900 and 1905, Monet did a series of paintings of the Houses of Parliament.",1
108,['28665-1london3.jpg'],In these works his art attained new heights.,1
109,['28665-1london3.jpg'],Everything visible is resolved in the reflection of light.,1
110,['28665-1london3.jpg'],"The subtitle of the painting, ""With the Sun Shining through Fog"", is significant.",1
111,['28665-1london3.jpg'],"Not only the sky, but also the river and even the buildings are fused together in dazzling colour tones.",0
112,['28665-1london3.jpg'],The Houses of Parliament rise up out of the fog like a vision.,0
113,['28665-1london3.jpg'],It is not the building which seems to be present but rather its optical effect,1
114,['25321-triptyc1.jpg'],This painting is the central panel of a triptych.,1
115,['25321-triptyc1.jpg'],"The wings represents Sts John the Baptist and Anthony of Padua with the donor Bonifazio Lupi (left), and Sts John the Evangelist and Louis of Toulouse with Catarina dei Francesi, the donor's wife.",0
116,['25321-triptyc1.jpg'],"While continuing to refer to Giotto, Florentine painters began to introduce a refined linear Gothic style.",1
117,['25321-triptyc1.jpg'],"An example is the triptych by Tommaso del Mazza, commisssioned for the main altar of the hospital founded in Florence by Bonifazio Lupi in 1386, and dedicated to Saint John the Baptist",1
118,['23919-denial.jpg'],"Manfredi created a series of theatrically lit compositions in which bawdy figures crowd around a table gambling, drinking and making music.",1
119,['23919-denial.jpg'],In his Denial of St Peter the tavern scene is transformed into a religious narrative in which the soldiers' game of dice is given more prominence than Peter's betrayal.,1
120,['23919-denial.jpg'],The religious event is thus cast within the context of secular life,1
121,['09017-11paris.jpg'],"The painting is included in Liber Veritatis (LV 117).The painting, also called The Ford, is a pendant to Ulysses Returns",1
122,['09017-11paris.jpg'],Chryseis her Father.,1
123,['21214-richter2.jpg'],"The mood of the time is very evident in the matching pair of portrait's of Franz Xaver Richter von Binnenthal, who was a Viennese official who had been ennobled, and his wife, Maria Angelica Richter von Binnenthal, n�e Freiin von Zach.",1
124,['21214-richter2.jpg'],The graceful wife bears the 25-year difference in age from her husband with the same dignity as he wears his 1814 medal.,0
125,['21214-richter2.jpg'],"Moreover, the colours of the clothing are skillfully balanced: her black dress with its white collar is the inversion of his Habsburg uniform.",0
126,['21214-richter2.jpg'],"Her white lace collar also indicates a fashion during the Restoration, when the house of Habsburg liked to look back to its old Spanish empire",0
127,['37680-interior.jpg'],The painting depicts an interior scene with two peasants eating herrings and drinking,0
128,['21435-fetewood.jpg'],"The composition reflects Lancret's dependence on Watteau, under whom he had briefly studied c. 1717.",1
129,['21435-fetewood.jpg'],Watteau's profound poetic feeling becomes in Lancret no more than a picturesque and amiable evocation of the life of society,1
130,['20040-032mocki.jpg'],"This painting is closely related to another work by Honthors, a vertical version of the same theme in a private collection.",1
131,['20040-032mocki.jpg'],"Since some of the same expressive devices are found in both pictures - for example , the way in which the extended hand of the standing mocker holding a candle casts its shadow on his face - both were likely to have been executed relatively close in time.",0
132,['20040-032mocki.jpg'],"The size of the canvas suggests that it was a public commisssion, perhaps for a church in or near Rome",1
133,['41521-z_battle.jpg'],This large tapestry cartoon represents a subject drawn from Livy and Polybius.,0
134,['41521-z_battle.jpg'],"It was preparatory for the weaving of a section of the Tapestry of Scipio executed in Brussels c. 1558 for Jacques d'Albon, Mar�chal de Saint-Andr� and favourite of King Henri II  of France.",1
135,['41521-z_battle.jpg'],"The artist, who was certainly Mantuan and shows himself here to be a follower of Giulio Romano, was perhaps Fermo Ghisoni (c. 1505-1575)",1
136,['39675-13tribut.jpg'],The subject of this painting is taken from the New Testament.,1
137,['39675-13tribut.jpg'],The Pharisees ask Christ whether it is right to pay tax to the Romans.,1
138,['39675-13tribut.jpg'],"Christ, sensing the trap, asks whose likeness and name are on the coinage: 'They say unto him, Caesar's.",1
139,['39675-13tribut.jpg'],"Then he saith unto them, render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's'",1
140,['39675-13tribut.jpg'],"(Matthew 22; Mark 12, Luke 20).This painting was probably painted for King Philip II and sent to Spain in 1568",1
141,['43701-crawford.jpg'],"This painting represents the full-length portrait of John 20th Earl of Crawford and Lindsay, ""The Gallant Earl of Crawford"" (1702-1749) dressed in Hussars' uniform holding a musket and standing in a highland landscape.",0
142,['43701-crawford.jpg'],Like his father he sought a military career; he entered the army in 1726 and was a captain in the 3rd foot guards by the end of 1734.,1
143,['43701-crawford.jpg'],"Undoubted bravery, far-flung service, generosity of spirit, and courageous persistence in living with a painful wound made ""the gallant earl"" a hero to his contemporaries",1
144,['29134-holy_fam.jpg'],"This painting looks like a genre picture but the bread and wine indicate that these are Mary, Joseph and the Christ Child",0
145,['19406-stillif1.jpg'],"Heda did not start to paint diagonal compositions until the mid-1630s: the compositions start with flat plates, continue with pieces of ham and goblets, and culminate in a zenith-like fashion with beer or water jug.",1
146,['19406-stillif1.jpg'],"At times this pattern was of course broken, especially when Heda had to depict the valuable crockery of distinguished households, such as columbine goblets, cups of welcome, etc.",1
147,['19406-stillif1.jpg'],Heda then went back either to his triangular or his pyramid-shaped compositions.,1
148,['19406-stillif1.jpg'],"But it is noticeable that whenever he did this, he also increased the incidence of 'chaotic' elements, showing, for example, the white table-cloth extremely crumpled as well as an overturned jug.",0
149,['19406-stillif1.jpg'],"(The overturning of goblets goes back to an ancient custom, and in the 16th and 17th centuries goldsmiths, for example, fashioned special goblets that had to be emptied all at once so that they could be placed on the table upside down.",1
150,['16070-joachi1.jpg'],"The elderly Joachim is denied entry to the temple, as he has remained childless.",0
151,['16070-joachi1.jpg'],"The architecture reinforces the priest's gesture of rejection, to which the saint replies with a saddened look.",1
152,['16070-joachi1.jpg'],"The sheep, as a sacrificial animal that has become superfluous, has a particularly touching effect.",0
153,['16070-joachi1.jpg'],The rejection of Joachim's sacrifice and his expulsion from the Temple occurred because of his childlessness.,1
154,['16070-joachi1.jpg'],"Here we are dealing with a true opening picture: the closed architecture of the temple introduces the first idea of solidity, while Joachim's dual movement brings this scene to a close, on the one hand, and on the other paves the way for the rest of the series, which finds a premature conclusion in the last picture of this register, the Meeting at the Golden Gate.",0
155,['16070-joachi1.jpg'],The action is also driven forward by the repetition of buildings.,1
156,['16070-joachi1.jpg'],Thus the temple of the opening picture reappears in the fresco Presentation of Christ at the Temple,1
157,['39719-2venus_a.jpg'],"Between 1553 and 1554 Titian executed for the Habsburgs two classical mythological works of clearly erotic intent which he himself described as ""poesie"" (mythological fables).",1
158,['39719-2venus_a.jpg'],"These are the Dana&#235; with a Nurse and the Venus and Adonis, both now in the Prado, Madrid.",1
159,['39719-2venus_a.jpg'],The Venus and Adonis became the prototype for a whole series of replicas of this subject.,1
160,['39719-2venus_a.jpg'],"Venus, the goddess of love, falls in love with Adonis, a beautiful youth.",1
161,['39719-2venus_a.jpg'],"Her love is not, however, enough to stop him pursuing his favourite pastime, hunting, which will lead to his undoing, for he is gored to death by a boar.",1
162,['39719-2venus_a.jpg'],There is an interesting letter from Titian to Philip II which deals with this painting.,1
163,['39719-2venus_a.jpg'],The artist makes a special point of mentioning that he was particularly interested in depicting the body from both sides.,1
164,['39719-2venus_a.jpg'],"In both paintings the scene of the union of the lovers is bathed in the warm light of sunset, where the diffuse softness of the colours holds sway.",0

408,['09642-grotesq1.jpg'],The complete series is likely to have comprised a number of other pictures of the same type.,1
409,['09642-grotesq1.jpg'],These pictures are trompe l'oeil works that depict fictive carved stone or stucco-work grotesques of scrolling vegetable ornament with intertwining flower garlands.,0
410,['09642-grotesq1.jpg'],It is unlikely that these grotesques existed as such and they were most probably copied from 16th or 17th-century ornamental prints.,1

412,['09642-grotesq1.jpg'],The repetition of the grotesque decorations and the downward-looking angle of the cherubs gaze in the paintings suggest that these pictures were intended to make up a frieze on the upper part of the wall in a private residence of the time.,1

424,['07486-16martha.jpg'],"It is a pretext for making passages of highly intensive painting and for constructing an image that, seen in the context of the usual dichotomy of Caravaggio's early years, is more of a genre scene than a religious one",1

427,['42149-conquest.jpg'],The iconographic theme of the hall of the Sala dello Scrutinio was inspired by the Venetian naval victories on the Eastern seas shown in the numerous ceiling canvases depicting virtues and symbolic figures.,1

437,['06288-backoper.jpg'],"The figures in Brouwer's later pictures, produced after he had settled in Antwerp, are especially animated in gesture and expression, manifesting an unprecedented display of skill matched only by the sophisticated style in which they were painted.",1
438,['06288-backoper.jpg'],The Back Operation is an outstanding representative of Brouwer's late style.,1
439,['06288-backoper.jpg'],"The artist has intensified the monochromatic effects of his earlier works, rendering them in a higher key than previously, and he has reduced his composition to just three figures who proportionally occupy a significant area of the interior space",1

446,['20473-emmaus.jpg'],The painter represented this subject in two paintings (in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and in the Hermitage).,1
447,['20473-emmaus.jpg'],These are half-figure compositions on a neutral dark background in which the figure of Christ is almost identical,0
448,['15337-jupiter.jpg'],"The composition of this painting is clearly related to a work by Luca Giordano depicting the Sleeping Venus with Cupid and a Satyr in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples.",1
449,['15337-jupiter.jpg'],"Given the great popularity of Giordano's work in Florence, it is conceivable that Gherardini knew the composition of Venus with Cupid and a Satyr through other versions or drawings, and presented it in his own idiom",1

462,['28339-pitti1.jpg'],"The architectonical elements of quadratura, or trompe-l'oeil, decoration provide the grand duke's Private Audience Hall with startling illusionistic effects.",1
463,['28339-pitti1.jpg'],On its rear wall Mitelli painted a grand double staircase that visually enlarges the actual size of the room through a deceptive perspectival device.,0
464,['28339-pitti1.jpg'],"The figure of a court official, painted by Mitelli's partner Angelo Michele Colonna (c. 1600-1687) is seen in the act of climbing the imaginary stairs, thus adding a sense of illusionary reality.",0
465,['28339-pitti1.jpg'],In the Palazzo Pitti commission the Colonna-Mitelli collaboration developed a successful model that the pair was able to translate to other situations.,1
466,['28339-pitti1.jpg'],"The best example of this is the painting, from a few years later, in the salone of the d'Este summer residence in Sassuolo, near Modena",1
467,['33315-stilmelo.jpg'],"The artist depicts in this still-life slices of watermelon on a pewter tray, with mushrooms and fruit.",0
468,['33315-stilmelo.jpg'],The work conforms to the characteristics of Recco's oeuvre,1
469,['05055-landscap.jpg'],"During his lifetime Bonzi was particularly renowned for his still-lifes, but, like Filippo Napoletano, he was also active as a painter of landscapes.",1

472,['05055-landscap.jpg'],"His foregrounds spread out freely without obstacles such as large rocks or bushes, almost inviting the viewer to walk into the picture.",0
473,['05055-landscap.jpg'],His rather awkward figures tend to move parallel to the picture plane in a frieze-like procession.,1
474,['05055-landscap.jpg'],"In the early 1620s he worked at the Palazzo Borghese on the Quirinal hill with Filippo Napoletano, each decorating different rooms.",1
475,['05055-landscap.jpg'],In this landscape Bonzi's close attention to naturalistic detail suggests the influence of Bril.,1
476,['05055-landscap.jpg'],"Establishing a chronology for Bonzi's landscapes is almost impossible, but this work is perhaps not too far in date from the Pallavicini-Rospigliosi frescoes.",1
477,['05055-landscap.jpg'],"The shepherds' nakedness indicates that the scene is not contemporary (even though sheep-farming had largely replaced cultivation in the Roman campagna around this time), but rather an episode from Virgil's Arcadia",1
478,['19792-elect01.jpg'],The painting belongs to the series entitled An Election,1
479,['28386-bearded.jpg'],"The sitter is most probably the artist's father, Giovan Battista Mola who himself was an architect.",1
480,['28386-bearded.jpg'],It appears as if the artist has portrayed his father as a biblical figure or a philosopher.,0

543,['30863-keys.jpg'],Among his frescoes in the Sistine Chapel the Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter is stylistically the most instructive.,1

551,['30863-keys.jpg'],"The active drapery, with its massive complexity, and the figures, particularly several apostles, including St John the Evangelist, with beautiful features, long flowing hair, elegant demeanour, and refinement recall St Thomas from Verrocchio's bronze group on Orsanmichele.",0

557,['30863-keys.jpg'],Perugino has made a significant contribution in rendering the landscape.,1
558,['30863-keys.jpg'],"The sense of an infinite world that stretches across the horizon is stronger than in almost any other work of his contemporaries, and the feathery trees against the cloud-filled sky with the bluish hills in the distance represent a solution that later painters would find instructive,",0

561,['10630-riverban.jpg'],"The young Cuyp, however, favoured a distinct yellow tonality as against van Goyen greyish and brown hues.",0
562,['10630-riverban.jpg'],More important for Cuyp's subsequent development was the impact of Dutch landscapists who brought an Italianate style from Rome back to Holland; Cuyp himself never travelled to the south.,1
563,['10630-riverban.jpg'],"Since very few of Cuyp's landscapes are dated, and none is dated after 1645, it is difficult to say precisely when the characteristic golden light, reminiscent of the Campagna the artist never saw, replaces the earlier paler one, and when mountain ranges, herds of cattle, and figures conspicuously set off against a sky begin to play an important role in his compositions.",1
564,['10630-riverban.jpg'],"But by 1645 distinct traces of the style of Cornelis Poelenburgh, a member of the first generation of Italianate painters, and Jan Both, the leading artist of the following generation of Italianate landscapists, are evident.",1
565,['10630-riverban.jpg'],Jan Both became Cuyp's principal source of inspiration.,1
566,['10630-riverban.jpg'],The River-bank with Cows shows how rapidly he assimilated Both's motifs and sun-drenched light.,0

583,['32451-sebastia.jpg'],This canvas is the creative legacy of Mattia Preti's stay in Naples.,1
584,['32451-sebastia.jpg'],The picture clearly takes off Caravaggio's light as its point of departure.,1
585,['32451-sebastia.jpg'],"The refined way in which it is painted, however, as well as the use of elegant details and the classically-inspired pose of the saint's statuesque body bathed in a ray of light are all extremely revealing about the painter's extensive and important travels.",1

1205,['38600-kermis.jpg'],"The sky, with its vivid stretches of cloud and the gold-tinged light of the evening on the left, is given a special weight, which lends the scene a cool, airy atmosphere and a festive mood.",0
1206,['38600-kermis.jpg'],"The joyful, lively antics of the farmers are not based on Teniers's own observations, but are pieced together from the handed-down repertoire of motifs for this genre, which were constantly varied and modified.",1
1207,['38600-kermis.jpg'],"They include the musicians standing on their podium, the three couples doing a round dance in the foreground, the drunk who is being helped home by two farmers, and the man who is leaning by the fence in an attack of nausea.",0

1468,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],As a rule the seated lamenting figures of the Virgin and St John are represented below the crucified Christ.,0
1469,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],But here both Christ and the cross have been removed and only the two of them remain in the place of the Crucifixion.,0
1470,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],"In front of them there are scattered the instruments of torture, whereas behind them - as though it were their common thought - the figure of the suffering Christ is to be seen surrounded by a cloud of angels.",0
1471,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],"His face is distorted by pain, His head is bowed forwards and His crossed arms have slipped slightly sideways in the sarcophagus.",0
1472,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],"The imagination of His mother and His favourite disciple have enlarged His figure into monumental dimensions, but the two react to the scene in different ways: the Virgin is leaning her face onto her hand and is engrossed in her thoughts; wrapped in her cloak, she stares into space.",0
1473,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],"St John is more agitated and active, and raises his head passionately.",0
1474,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],The difference between the vision and the real scene is shown not only in the scale of the figures but also in the technique of drawing.,1
1475,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],"The Virgin, St John and the ground are modelled with the most delicate tints of grey, while the paler figure of Christ is interpreted by more linear means, first of all with contours, whereas the host of angels is conveyed only by gossamer fine outlines.",0
1476,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],"The drawing may have been a preparatory sketch to a painting, its composition being based on a strictly geometrical framework.",1
1477,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],The central axis of the picture is indicated by two nails lying in the foreground and meeting at their tips.,0
1478,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],"If we, in our imagination, lengthen their lines up to the top corners we get two smaller triangles on the two sides and a larger one in the middle of the top.",1
1479,['40998-08virdol.jpg'],"The former include the figures of the Virgin and of St John respectively, whereas the latter frames Christ's figure with the angels, whose whirling movements fill up the triangle standing on its point",0
1480,['22302-family1.jpg'],"Arrigo Licinio, also a painter, was the elder brother of the artist.",1
1481,['22302-family1.jpg'],"Throughout his career Licinio remained aware of stylistic trends in Venice, but his portraits are nevertheless remarkably lacking in rhetoric and flourish.",1
1482,['22302-family1.jpg'],"Many critics have termed them ""Lombard.",1
1483,['10054-stillif2.jpg'],"This painting presents a still-life of fruit, a walnut, insects and a snail",0
1484,['05412-hunting.jpg'],The painting is signed to the left on the wall:,1
1485,['05412-hunting.jpg'],"ABoth 1630.This is the earliest dated work of the artist, painted before he went to Italy.",1
1486,['05412-hunting.jpg'],A ludicrous scene showing a peasant engrossed in the business of removing fleas from the body of a man kneeling half clothed in front of him.,0
1487,['05412-hunting.jpg'],A third peasant holds a candle to illuminate the operation while a fourth watches with close attention.,0
1488,['05412-hunting.jpg'],"This picture of peasant 'hunting' is just as successful as the artist's Romantic, Baroque scenes of the hunting parties of the aristocracy",1
1489,['41150-bridal.jpg'],"The happy appearance of this scene is belied by the picture on its reverse side, which shows the lovers as rotting corpses",0
1490,['22605-9annunci.jpg'],This  is an early version of the theme of Annunciation which Fra Filippo Lippi treated several times during his career.,1
1491,['22605-9annunci.jpg'],Lippi shows the figures caught in a diagonal shaft of light that falls across the back of the angel and illuminates the Virgin by passing through an open door notionally located behind a pilaster with engaged columns.,0
1492,['22605-9annunci.jpg'],The bilateral division of the Annunciation by a prominent architectural feature is a hallmark of Lippi's early work,1
1493,['41312-01madonn.jpg'],"Originally venerated in the convent church of Santa Maria in Campo Marzio (Rome) this painting is an icon: its miraculous powers are attested by Bombelli, in his 1792 engraving of the panel.",1
1494,['41312-01madonn.jpg'],"Iconographically, the image is connected to the Constantinopolitan ""Haghiosoritissa"", a type of image in which the Virgin is represented in the act of interceding with Christ on behalf of the human race.",1
1495,['41312-01madonn.jpg'],The proposed dating of the painting to the middle of the twelfth century is generally accepted on the basis of stylistic similarities to a panel of the Last Judgment in the Pinacoteca of the Vatican Museums.,1
1496,['41312-01madonn.jpg'],"Stylistically different from other Roman panels that depict the same subject, the painting has been assigned to the same hand that executed the Blessing Christ (Vatican Museums, Pinacoteca), a picture that also originally decorated Santa Maria in Campo Marzio.",1
1497,['41312-01madonn.jpg'],The two works are characterized by an accentuated linearism typical of Byzantine style and a monumental quality that is distinctly Roman.,1
1498,['41312-01madonn.jpg'],"They show identical treatments of chiaroscuro effects, simplified folds of the drapery, and effects light.",1
1499,['41312-01madonn.jpg'],"Also shared by the two paintings are the brown intonations in the face, which give little concession to colorism, and certain signature characteristics like the rapid brushwork with which the artist defines the folds of Christ's neck or the dark triangle that divides the eyebrows of the Virgin.",0
1500,['41312-01madonn.jpg'],"The inscription at the bottom: ""SCA VIRGO VIRGINUM""",1
1501,['19819-portrai2.jpg'],"The two panels in the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection, representing the portraits of a man and a woman, reveal the artist's interest in depicting the physical characteristics of his sitters, both of whom have rather pronounced features.",1
1502,['19819-portrai2.jpg'],"Art historians have generally assumed the portraits to form a pair, possibly showing a husband and wife.",1
1503,['19819-portrai2.jpg'],"However, it is odd that they are depicted in different formats and poses, with the woman in profile and the man in less than full profile, his body slightly turned.",0
1504,['19819-portrai2.jpg'],It would be more usual for them to be painted looking at each other in symmetrical poses,1
1505,['12469-musicmak.jpg'],"In this painting a pensive, richly dressed young woman is listening to a lutenist who has his back to her.",0
1506,['12469-musicmak.jpg'],"Rather than appearing to be a marital portrait, this picture may instead come closer to a genre scene.",1
1507,['13435-3mohren2.jpg'],"This painting is a copy after Conrad Faber von Creuznach's painting, now in the Mus�es Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels.",1
1508,['13435-3mohren2.jpg'],It is debated whether it is an autograph replica by the painter himself or the work of an anonymous copyist.,1
1509,['13435-3mohren2.jpg'],It is probably by a copyist.,1
1510,['13435-3mohren2.jpg'],The bearded sitter in this portrait rests his arms on a stone parapet and holds a rosary with a pomander attached.,0
1511,['13435-3mohren2.jpg'],"He wears a broad-rimmed hat over a gold cap, a fur coat over a black shirt and white undershirt, and a gold ring on the left index finger.",0
1512,['13435-3mohren2.jpg'],"In the background at left, a bridge over a lake leads to a rocky outcropping topped by a castle; on the right there is a house near a winding road, and fortifications at the edge of the lake are connected to an island by a bridge",0
1513,['18350-1501grec.jpg'],"There are many versions of The Agony in the Garden painted by El Greco and his workshop, it was one of his most successful inventions.",1
1514,['18350-1501grec.jpg'],He painted the subject both as a horizontal and as a vertical composition.,1
1515,['18350-1501grec.jpg'],The version in And�jar is probably the prime version of the vertical type.,1
1516,['18350-1501grec.jpg'],"There are other vertical versions in Cuenca, Spain, in Budapest and in Buenos Aires.",1
1517,['29433-peasants.jpg'],In this genre scene three men are depicted relaxing in a sparse interior as one plays his violin and the others jovially hold a pipe and vessels for drinking.,0

1523,['14319-mad_sai.jpg'], ,1
1524,['14319-mad_sai.jpg'],"This is evoked by his simple arrangements of figures, usually parallel with the picture surface in the immediate foreground and the tender, almost sentimental expression of his Madonnas and saints.",1
1525,['14319-mad_sai.jpg'],The painting technique with the smooth treatment of the surface conforms with this style,1
1526,['06218-capponi.jpg'],The young Ludovico Capponi (1534-1614) is depicted at the age of seventeen.,0
1527,['06218-capponi.jpg'],His black and white clothes allude to the colours of his family's coat-of-arms,0
1528,['00960-03prede3.jpg'],There are four panels in various collections which belonged originally to the predella of an unidentified altarpiece.,1
1529,['00960-03prede3.jpg'],"The panels illustrate stories from the legends of the Virgin Mary, the apostle St James the Great, St John the Baptist, and Sts Francis and Dominic.",0
1530,['00960-03prede3.jpg'],The scenes are the following: The Apostle St James the Great Freeing the Magician Hermogenes; The Naming of St John the Baptist; The Burial of the Virgin and the Reception of Her Soul in heaven; The Meeting of Sts Dominic and Francis of Assisi.,1
1531,['00960-03prede3.jpg'],The fifth panel of the predella is lost.,1
1532,['00960-03prede3.jpg'],The altarpiece would have shown the Virgin and Child and the same saints whose scenes are depicted in the predella.,1
1533,['00960-03prede3.jpg'],"The predella panels show the influence of Masaccio's frescoes in the Brancacci Chapel, specific derivations from them can be detected in most scenes",1
1534,['17546-04portra.jpg'],"This portrait bears a striking resemblance to certain of the putative images of Gossart (e.g. in Jan Wierix's engraving), therefore it is perhaps a self-portrait, that could explain the unusually casual and loose manner in which it was painted",1
1535,['24259-judith.jpg'],The pendant of the painting representing Salome with the head of the Baptist is also in the Budapest museum.,1
1536,['24259-judith.jpg'],"The two paintings mark a perceptive continuation of the style of Carlo Dolci, Marinari's teacher and cousin, but interpreted in a luminist vein reminiscent of Pietro da Cortona",1
1537,['40733-01icon.jpg'],"The centre of the high altar in the Santa Maria della Salute holds the icon of the Madonna of Health, installed here in November 1670.",0
1538,['40733-01icon.jpg'],"It came from Candia cathedral where it was known as the San Tito Madonna or Mesopanditissa (after the day on which it was celebrated, between Christmas and the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple).",1
1539,['40733-01icon.jpg'],Doge Morosini brought it to Venice as a trophy after peace had been made with the Turks at the end of the Candia war.,1
1540,['40733-01icon.jpg'],"Tradition has it that the artist was St Luke the Evangelist and that it is consequently a miraculous sacred image, but it was actually the work of a 12th century Madonna painter.",1
1541,['40733-01icon.jpg'],The shadowed face and penetrating eyes are particularly effective,0
1542,['29311-painter.jpg'],In this studio scene one could interpret the way in which the painter looks at the viewer as a welcome to his imaginary workplace,1
1543,['26346-composin.jpg'],The emphasis on gentility and opulence intensified in Metsu's works during the final years  of his career as did his painstaking technique which became harder and drier.,1
1544,['26346-composin.jpg'],Such works as the Young Woman Composing Music present a rarefied view of the leisure life of moneyed urbanites.,0
1545,['26346-composin.jpg'],"In this panel, a woman gazes serenely as if lost in thought as she composes music, poised to record the notes played by her lute-strumming confidant behind the table.",0
1546,['26346-composin.jpg'],"A man, perhaps an admirer, peers over her shoulder as she works.",0
1547,['26346-composin.jpg'],The room is extravagantly decorated from its wooden table bedecked with an expensive Turkish carpet to the eye-catching mantelpiece that mimics a real one in the Amsterdam Town Hall.,0
1548,['26346-composin.jpg'],The painting above the mantelpiece is a seascape with a storm-stossed boat,0
1549,['07159-canal110.jpg'],"The view is taken from the Palazzo Foscari on the sharp bend in the Grand Canal, known as the Volta de Canal, roughly equidistant from its entrance onto the Bacino di San Marco and the Rialto Bridge.",1
1550,['07159-canal110.jpg'],"Looking North-East from there the whole of the longest straight stretch of the canal is visible, as far as the Rialto Bridge, part of which is shown in the far distance, with the roof and dome of the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo beyond.",0
1551,['07410-pepoli2.jpg'],"From a young age, the painter enjoyed the protection of the Pepoli family.",1
1552,['07410-pepoli2.jpg'],Count Odoardo Pepoli commissioned Canuti to paint two long oval ceiling pictures in the stairwell of the Palazzo Pepoli Campogrande.,1
1553,['07410-pepoli2.jpg'],They illustrated significant events from the life of Taddeo Pepoli.,1
1554,['07410-pepoli2.jpg'],"Canuti here shows himself to have been a close student of Veronese, from whom, in addition to the oval shape and certain compositional elements, he adopted the extreme view from below",0
1555,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],The early decades of the sixteenth century in Cremona were some of the most turbulent in its political history.,1
1556,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],"In these years of constantly changing foreign rulers, the local leaders of Cremona pursued an elaborate project of decoration with remarkable consistency.",1
1557,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],From 1506 to 1522 the community had the chancel and nave of the twelve-century cathedral frescoed.,1
1558,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],"By continuing the decoration through all the changes in government, the community represented its own identity; it was an act of local self-assertion.",1

1560,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],"Boccaccio Boccaccino depicted, following a time-honoured scheme, the Epiphany of God in the Last Days (Christ in Majesty) as the principal and culminating image within the church space.",0

1564,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],"Boccaccino painted the scenes above the first four arches of the nave, and Giovan Francesco Bembo had been active above the fifth arch.",1
1565,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],"He was not awarded another commission, the fresco cycle was continued by the Cremonese artist Altobello Melone.",1
1566,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],"His contract regarding the frescoes above the next arch stipulated that his works should surpass in beauty Boccaccino's frescoes of the first two arches, which had been unveiled in 1515.",1
1567,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],Melone painted the Flight to Egypt and the Massacre of the Innocents with a wealth of motifs and drastic narrative.,1
1568,['25926-cremona1.jpg'],"The protagonists have left the ideal, solemnly harmonious sphere of joyful childhood that Boccaccino's style suitably mirrors and have entered into a dramatic world depicted in Melone's coarser style.",1

2567,['13403-15arnol.jpg'],The mirror thus acts as a sort of hole in the texture of space.,1
2568,['13403-15arnol.jpg'],"It sucks the entire visual world into itself, transforming it into a representation.",1
2569,['13403-15arnol.jpg'],The cubic space in which the Arnolfinis stand is itself a prefiguration of the techniques of perspective which were still to come.,1
2570,['13403-15arnol.jpg'],"Van Eyck practised perspective on a purely heuristic basis, unaware of the laws by which it was governed.",1
2571,['13403-15arnol.jpg'],"In this picture, he uses the mirror precisely in order to explode the limits of the space to which his technique gives him access as soon as it threatens to limit him",1
2572,['40129-aquinas.jpg'],The subject of this altarpiece is usually described as the Triumph of St Thomas Aquinas.,1
2573,['40129-aquinas.jpg'],"In it the saint is depicted with open books in his hands and on his lap, receiving inspiration from above via Christ, Paul, Moses, and the Evangelists, and from below via Aristotle and Plato, while Avarro&#235;s",0
2574,['40129-aquinas.jpg'],lies at his feet,0
2575,['20083-11hooch.jpg'],"This painting, also titled as A Merry Company with Two Men and Two Women, is one of the first genre pictures by De Hooch in which the figures rise above the level of soldiers visiting inns and in which the setting makes tentative claims to gentility.",0
2576,['20083-11hooch.jpg'],De Hooch took the ideas from Anthonie Palamedesz and Jacob van Velsen in Delft and from many painters in other cities.,1
2577,['20083-11hooch.jpg'],The Visit  represents the domestication of a social theme that had earlier been set mostly in taverns and bordellos.,1
2578,['20083-11hooch.jpg'],In slightly later years De Hooch would depict more luxurious rooms and superficially more polite behaviour than he did in this key work of his early maturity,1
2579,['41643-paradise.jpg'],This painting is monogrammed B and dated 1576.,1
2580,['41643-paradise.jpg'],"The anonymous painter is referred to as Monogrammist B of 1576, but he is perhaps identical with Joost de Beer (active 1550,",1
2581,['41643-paradise.jpg'],d. before 1595 in Utrecht).,1
2582,['41643-paradise.jpg'],He transformed D�rer's famous Adam and Eve engraving into a panel painting.,1
2583,['41643-paradise.jpg'],He placed the Fall of Man scene into the centre of a paradise landscape.,0
2584,['41643-paradise.jpg'],In the distant background the episode of Creation of Adam can be seen,0
2585,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],"This type of Piet&#224;, whether or not accompanied by other holy women, appears more than once in Gerard David's oeuvre and was adopted on various occasions by painters of his circle such as Adriaan Isenbrant or Ambrosius Benson.",1
2586,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],A model drawing may have existed in David's studio or perhaps there was another prototype by his hand which is now lost.,1
2587,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],On closer examination David seems here to have built on both Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memling.,1
2588,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],"The composition of the scene is a kind of reprise of Memling's Reins triptych (Memlingmuseum, Bruges).",1
2589,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],"Here too, the scene is set in front of a landscape with on the left buildings intended to represent Jerusalem and on the right a group of rocks which serves as a repoussoir.",0
2590,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],"The tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, which he placed at Christ's disposal, has been hewn out of the rocks here.",1
2591,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],"Wearing a turban and exotic clothing he stands in profile before the tombstone, while Nicodemus enters the tomb.",0
2592,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],With Memling it is a Roman sarcophagus which stands in front of the rock and which is being opened by Joseph and Nicodemus.,0
2593,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],"The composition itself, with the body held almost upright under the armpits and the head nodding to one side, derives from the right wing of Hugo van der Goes' Lamentation diptych (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna).",0
2594,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],The figure of the Virgin placed parallel along Christ's body with her arm diagonally across it is an adaptation in reverse of the Virgin's posture in Van der Goes.,0
2595,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],The same is probably also the case with the position of the squatting Mary Magdalene.,1
2596,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],"The St John, with his right knee and foot in frontal view, is also borrowed from Memling's Reins triptych.",0
2597,['10917-lamentat.jpg'],The spire in the landscape is probably intended to suggest Bruges' Our Lady's Church,0
2598,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"The painting affords a view of the Serenissima's most characteristic quay: the Molo, with the columns of San Marco and San Todaro (or Teodoro) framing the entrance to the city.",0
2599,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"On the left stands the Ducal Palace, rendered in minute detail.",0
2600,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],The steep perspective in which the building is captured continues into the background along the Riva degli Schiavoni.,0
2601,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"Cast in contrasting light and truncated by the upper border of the image, the column of San Todaro dominates the scene.",0
2602,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],Between it and the column of San Marco the mast of a schooner appears in the background; it marks the central axis of the composition.,0
2603,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"Together with the large schooner on the right, the column of San Todaro to some extent counterbalances the buildings which occupy the left side.",0
2604,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"There is much activity both on the water and in the Square, where most of the figures are gathered in small groups.",0
2605,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],This view of the Molo and the Ducal Palace towards the east is highly unusual.,1
2606,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"Instead of depicting the Palace frontally, Carlevaris turned a quarter circle so that we look down the fa�ade of the building towards the Riva degli Schiavoni, a composition he also used in four later works.",1
2607,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"The vantage-point in all these works is from the loggia of the Library, directly opposite the Ducal Palace.",1
2608,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"Although the architecture dominates the composition, the artist paid close attention to the human figures.",0
2609,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],Drawn or painted studies for several of the macchiette have survived.,1
2610,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],Scenes of people and situations drawn from everyday life were introduced to Italy in the first half of the seventeenth century by Dutch painters active in Rome.,1
2611,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],In the course of the century the so-called Bamboccianti cast such everyday scenes with growing frequency against a &#151; sometimes identifiable &#151; urban background.,1
2612,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"One of these painters was Johannes Lingelbach, whose work seems to have inspired Carlevaris's vedute.",1
2613,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"The Venetian artist is thought to have spent some time in Rome, where he could have become familiar with Lingelbach's work.",1
2614,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],Carlevaris's town views are also deeply rooted in the Venetian tradition of depicting historic or festive events.,1
2615,['07663-carlev08.jpg'],"His View of the Molo with the Ducal Palace, however, does not document a procession, reception or other festivity; rather, it subordinates the human figures to a portrayal of one part of the city in meticulous, topographically correct detail from an unorthodox point of view",1
2616,['44383-winterla.jpg'],"Reveling in an expanse of sky, in the physical insignificance of Humankind, Wouwerman pays homage to the elements, to Nature's irrational, unbalanced aspects, with all of us in her thrall, never more so than in the dead of winter.",0
2617,['44383-winterla.jpg'],"Qualities of the picturesque, the irregular, decorative tricks of the eighteenth-century artist's trade, are anticipated by this scene",1
2618,['39170-09valma.jpg'],This scene is on the wall of the room with Rustic Scenes in the Foresteria of the Villa Valmarana.,1
2619,['39170-09valma.jpg'],"Within curious frames interwoven with rings that were painted in advance by Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna, and almost seem to open up the walls of the space to the surrounding countryside, Tiepolo painted some of his most compelling works.",1
2620,['39170-09valma.jpg'],"One is the Peasants at Rest in which the characters gather during the hot hours of the day to converse in the shade of a large tree near their house, having momentarily abandoned their wearying labour in the fields",0
2621,['22145-ludovisi.jpg'],"This sensitive portrait of Ludovico, turning his head to meet the gaze of the viewer, must have been painted by Ottavio Leoni shortly after Ludovico, a prot�g� of Pope Gregory XV (1621-1623), became cardinal.",1
2622,['22145-ludovisi.jpg'],"Wearing the ring symbolic of his new office, his lively right hand grasps the chair, while his left hand languidly holds a letter, likely alluding to Ludovico's duties as secretary of state.",0
2623,['22145-ludovisi.jpg'],"In the seated, three-quarter length format the influence of Raphael can be noted",1
2624,['34032-2renoi13.jpg'],This picture is one of Renoir's largest composition.,1
2625,['34032-2renoi13.jpg'],It features the cheerful attitude to life and the Impressionist theme of figures in the open air.,1
2626,['34032-2renoi13.jpg'],The assembled company are enjoying the carefree mood of a Sunday and the agreeable warmth of the sunlight filtering through the leaves.,0
2627,['34032-2renoi13.jpg'],"Renoir painted the canvas directly from the scene, the models in the foreground are his friends.",0
2628,['34032-2renoi13.jpg'],"The Moulin de la Galette was a dancing garden, created by converting two old windmills in Montmartre, where the public could come and dance on Sundays",1
2629,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],The Louvre Annunciation is the central panel of a triptych the wings of which are most probably not the work of Rogier.,1
2630,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],Its style is quite different from that of the Descent from the Cross and shows closer affinities to that of Jan Van Eyck.,1
2631,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"It even reproduces certain details familiar to us from the Arnolfini Marriage, including the red of the bed clothes and hangings and the carved copper chandelier.",1
2632,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"Instead of the famous convex mirror, the painting features a copper medallion glinting in the background.",0
2633,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"This is also a picture replete with symbols in typical Campin style: lily, ewer and basin for purifying water, representing the purity of the Virgin Mary; a phial traversed by a ray of light evoking the miraculous birth; an orange or ""Chinese apple"", fruit of the forbidden tree, reminding us of the necessity of Redemption; extinguished candles, awaiting the coming of the Light, i.e. the Word made flesh.",0
2634,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"The painting seems to have been designed to suit the Flemish taste for intimate domestic scenes, according to which painters were expected to portray religious themes in familiar bourgeois interiors.",1
2635,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"Yet, this does not derive from any concern for the minutiae of realist detail, but from properly theological reasons.",1
2636,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"The new religious tendency in Flanders at that time was the ""devotio moderna"".",1
2637,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"This doctrine urged the believer to meditate on Christ's humanity, by representing it to himself in the context of his present life.",1
2638,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"In Rogier's painting, the contemporary setting, underlined by the absence of haloes, is meant to draw the viewer in so that he effectively participates in the scene before him.",1
2639,['43965-2tripti1.jpg'],"This is why the angel Gabriel appears before Mary dressed in an immaculate alb and magnificent brocade cope, as if he had come to celebrate mass, rather than deliver a message",0
2640,['21261-port_man.jpg'],This small double-sided panel bears a portrait of a man on one side and a depiction of a girl making a garland on the reverse.,0
2641,['21261-port_man.jpg'],The identity of the young man is not known.,1
2642,['21261-port_man.jpg'],"Rather than a portrait, the girl on the reverse side is a female type, symbolizing a lover or perspective bride.",0
2643,['21261-port_man.jpg'],This is among the relatively few extant early sixteenth-century panels that join a portrait with an emblematic or allegorical subject on the verso,1
2644,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"With far-reaching stylistic similarities in their monochromatic, tonal treatment of the subject, Salomon van Ruysdael's river landscapes and those of Jan van Goyen from the 1630s are almost indistinguishable.",1
2645,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"However, around 1645 the first-named artist discovered the pictorial possibilities of the tree motif in compositions, through the work of his much more famous nephew Jacob Isaacksz.",1
2646,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"van Ruisdael, in which this element plays a key role.",1
2647,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"This gave his variations on the theme a new impulse, and between 1645 and 1655 he painted a series of peaceful, limpid views with which he reached the summit of his art.",1
2648,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"With the cautious expansion of his palette and the more self confident style typical of these years, his work is also much more distinctively his own.",1
2649,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],The compositional structure to which this landscape owes its attractiveness is of a bold simplicity.,1
2650,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],A quarter of the way up the picture the horizontal axis intersects a vertical axis provided by the dark silhouette of a group of trees rising up on the opposite river bank.,0
2651,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"This divides the picture into two zones, of almost identical size, but in formal contrast to each other.",1
2652,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"In the left half each individual motif, under a highly atmospheric sky, bathes in an aura of lightness and weightlessness, contrasting with the right half, where mass and volume are piled up in the form of a farmstead, overshadowed by the tree group.",0
2653,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"Within this constellation even the ferry in the left foreground, laden low with a four-in-hand and a large number of passengers, appears like a fallen leaf carried along effortlessly by the river, the connecting feature stretching through this landscape.",0
2654,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"Within Salomon van Ruysdael's work, catalogued by Wolfgang Stechow, this painting represents an exception from his otherwise typical use of diagonals in his compositions.",1
2655,['35820-ferrybo.jpg'],"But whenever in later works he returns to this traditional pattern, this Ferryboat appears to have been a key work for the discovery of new waterside motifs, providing the viewer with variety and entertainment during his visual walk along never-ending river banks",1
2656,['27081-oyster_e.jpg'],"Mieris's work are marked by the exceptional thoroughness of details, an effective variety of textures, and a smooth manner of painting akin to that of enamel miniatures.",1
2657,['27081-oyster_e.jpg'],The everyday subject has an obvious erotic subtext: the richly furnished interior and elegant attire mask the vice that is cultivated in this establishment dedicated to gratification.,0
2658,['27081-oyster_e.jpg'],"The gentleman offers oysters, a symbol of lust and base pleasures.",0
2659,['27081-oyster_e.jpg'],The woman's feigned shyness cannot hide her satiated ennui,0
2660,['16680-pieta.jpg'],This panel probably belonged to the predella of an altarpiece.,1
2661,['16680-pieta.jpg'],The influence of Raphaelesque models can be recognized in the painting,1
2662,['05008-findmose.jpg'],"This painting and The Feast of Dives (Accademia, Venice) are considered Bonifacio's masterpieces.",1
2663,['05008-findmose.jpg'],"He has used the subject as an excuse to paint an open-air holiday scene, in which the luxuriousness of the clothes melts into the opulent landscape dotted with little genre scenes.",0
2664,['05008-findmose.jpg'],"In overall decorative effect, the painting is much like a tapestry.",1
2665,['05008-findmose.jpg'],"Bonifacio's sources of inspiration include Titian and Dosso, with some influence from northern European painters.",1
2666,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],The painting has become one of the most celebrated images of eighteenth-century taste.,1
2667,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"Zoffany shows a group of connoisseurs and members of the nobility admiring works of art in the Tribuna, the principal room of the Uffizi in Florence, which was the most famous gallery in the world during the eighteenth century.",0
2668,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],The Tribuna had been built by Francesco de' Medici in 1585-9 to a design by Bernardo Buontalenti as a showcase for the most precious items in the Medici collection.,1
2669,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"Although Zoffany has depicted the architectural features of the Tribuna with a fair degree of accuracy, he has rearranged the works of art and in some cases altered their scale.",1
2670,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"In fact, he has also incorporated a number of paintings from that part of the Medici collection housed in the Palazzo Pitti, as well as including several additional pieces of sculpture.",1
2671,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"The painter thus successfully gives the gallery a more crowded and undoubtedly richer appearance than it had during the eighteenth century, and by this means has facilitated his rendering of the complicated sightlines of the room and the perspectival inlaid marble decoration of the floor.",1
2672,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"The setting is therefore somewhat idealised, but it remains a perfectly accurate representation of the significance of the Tribuna for eighteenth-century connoisseurship, with its emphasis on the antique, the High Renaissance, the Bolognese school and Rubens.",1
2673,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"Zoffany painted the picture in Florence expressly for Queen Charlotte, beginning in 1772.",1
2674,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"Much of the composition was completed the following year, but the artist continued working on it intermittently until late in 1777, making changes some of which are now only visible by X-ray.",1
2675,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"Notable among these changes is the inclusion of a self portrait on the left of the composition, where the artist has shown himself peering round the unframed canvas of the Virgin and Child by Raphael.",0
2676,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"For this purpose, it is almost as if the painter has abandoned his easel, partly visible in the lower right corner of the picture, and walked across or around the back of the room to partake in the discussion.",0
2677,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"The figures in the picture, all of whom are identifiable, fall into three groups: those on the left between the sculptures of Cupid and Psyche and Satyr with the Cymbals; those in the foreground, right of centre, gathered around the Venus d'Urbino by Titian; and those on the right around the Venus de' Medici.",0
2678,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"These portraits were meticulously painted by Zoffany and won widespread admiration, although apparently not from George III and Queen Charlotte, who claimed that such recognisable figures were inappropriate to the scene.",1
2679,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"In essence, however, Zoffany has amalgamated the traditional subject of a gallery view, much exploited by Flemish painters in the seventeenth century, with the conversation piece evolved by British painters during the eighteenth century, although recently other more cryptic levels of meaning have been sought in the picture.",1
2680,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],Royal patronage enabled the artist to have the Venus d'Urbino by Titian taken down from the wall for copying after the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Ferdinando I) had specifically decreed that the picture had been copied too much and should not be moved again for such a purpose.,1
2681,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"Correspondingly, there are one or two references in the picture to the Royal Collection: the Virgin and Child by Raphael, held by the artist, was a work that was offered to George III by Earl Cowper (this is the Niccolini-Cowper Madonna, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington) and the Samian Sibyl by Guercino, seen at the lower edge of the composition, is a pendant to the Libyan Sibyl by the same artist bought by George III in the 1760s.",1
2682,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],The Tribuna of the Uffizi is a technical tour de force.,1
2683,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"The attention to detail and texture involves not just the portraits, but also the copies after the works of art nearly all of which are identifiable.",1
2684,['44680-tribuna.jpg'],"Controlled brushwork and careful application are the hallmarks of Zoffany's style, and they are seen at their best in this famous picture without any of the loss of verve that such a long and elaborate undertaking might have forced upon the artist.",1
2685,['43243-elegant.jpg'],In the magnificent gardens of a country palace a group of young and fashionable figures have assembled for a banquet beneath the trees.,0
2686,['43243-elegant.jpg'],"It is an early example of f&#234;te galantes painted in the Netherlands in the early seventeenth century that would prove hugely influential on Dutch painting, especially in Haarlem, for a generation or more.",1

3445,['15231-4recamie.jpg'],"The Spartan severity of David's composition, the Neoclassical sparseness of the arrangement, the cool handling of the room, the distanced pose, with the lady turning her shoulder to the viewer, were all elements with which Neoclassicism had operated for long enough.",1

3529,['22942-09ridott.jpg'],"It should be borne in mind, however, that his connection with Goldoni and the teachings of Emilia encouraged him, through the observation of reality, to perform a kind of analysis of ""social depths""; he did not want to cause an upheaval but only wanted to point out &#151; perhaps tendentiously &#151; the ineptitude of a declining class of society.",1

3536,['14977-tahiti23.jpg'],"In Fatata te miti the sexual abandonment is seen as part of the natural rhythm of Polynesian life (the two women do not appear perturbed at the presence of the fisherman in the background of the work), a notion that was integral to the highly popular Marriage of Loti, which Gauguin had read before visiting Tahiti and which was calculated to appeal to a Parisian audience",1
3537,['38903-00bagli1.jpg'],"The frescoes decorating the main hall of the villa in Massanzago in the Province of Padua were attributed until the 1980s to various eighteenth-century painters, such as Jacopo Guarana, Giovanni Battista Crosato or Giambattista Pittoni.",1

3693,['07775-60meetin.jpg'],"The style of the canvas would appear to suggest a more mature period than the Pilgrims' Arrival in Cologne canvas, which dates from 1490.The scene of the meeting takes place in the bright afternoon light: to the left, the retinue of virgins is shown approaching along the path, while the English Prince and Ursula, in the centre, kneel in front of Pope Cyriacus; and to the right the procession of bishops, prelates and dignitaries unfolds in the bright, sunlit meadow outside the walls of Rome.",1

3728,['13919-p_hulft.jpg'],The portrait within the painted frame is typical of Flinck's style in the 1650s.,1
3729,['13919-p_hulft.jpg'],By then he had largely abandoned a Rembrandtesque style in favour of a brighter manner of painting inspired by Van Dyck.,1

3731,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],"In the work of Paulus Potter views of nature and animals are seen for their own sake, and not as a backdrop for human action.",1

3733,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],"His best-known work is the life-size Young Bull, an unusual heroization of a single animal, a counterpart to the monumental trend of Ruisdael and Cuyp.",1
3734,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],"Although at first sight it appears to be a portrait of a prize young bull Potter most probably composed his famous beast from studies of more than one animal since its dewlap, horns, and teeth belong to bulls of different ages.",0
3735,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],"The ancient Greek painter Zeuxis used a similar method; when he painted his portrait of Helen in the city of Croton he chose five beautiful virgins, in order to copy the finest features of each, for in one woman he felt he could not find perfect beauty.",1
3736,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],What makes this painting so special is the fact that Potter painted something as ordinary as a bull on such a grand scale - which had never been done before.,1
3737,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],"And despite this large size, he paid great attention to the smallest details.",1
3738,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],During the nineteenth century the Young Bull by the twenty-two-year-old Potter ranked close in fame to the Night Watch of Rembrandt.,1
3739,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],Later generations have been less captivated by Potter's fidelity to nature when he worked life-size.,1
3740,['32150-y_bull.jpg'],"Although the shapes of the farmer, the tree, and the bull against the light sky are impressive and the textures of the animals have been convincingly represented by the use of an original impasto which approaches relief, the entire foreground of this huge canvas seems airless.",0

3748,['13632-09ferenc.jpg'],The foreground is divided according to  colours and forms (dark skinned people and figures wearing white mantles) which find their counterpoints in peaceful blue and brown patches of the background.,0
3749,['13632-09ferenc.jpg'],The background and the sunset making colours brighter unite the composition with Joseph and a man in a luxurious mantle in the middle who rises to the same level of importance as Joseph is because of the golden mantle complementing the blue of the sky and the river.,0
3750,['13632-09ferenc.jpg'],"The picture was painted from beginning to end in the open air, as it is known from Val�r's letter to his father, the size of the picture must have presented a lot of technical problems.",1

3752,['10207-1paris4.jpg'],This mythological theme was very popular with the humanist-educated bourgeoisie as well as the court and Cranach the Elder painted it often.,1

3756,['17802-706goya.jpg'],The woman reading the letter has been thought to be a portrait.,0
3757,['17802-706goya.jpg'],"One critic even suggested that she was the Duchess of Alba (who had died many years before the painting was made), and that she is represented with washerwomen in the background to illustrate a theme of 'Industry and Idleness'.",1
3758,['17802-706goya.jpg'],It has also been suggested that Goya intended this painting as a pendant to Time and the Old Women.,1
3759,['17802-706goya.jpg'],"The two canvases are almost exactly the same size, were acquired for the Mus�e des Beaux-Arts, Lille, at the same time and have the same provenance.",1
3760,['17802-706goya.jpg'],"But there seems to be no obvious connection between the subjects of the two paintings and Time and the Old Women, which is known to have been in Goya's possession in 1812, is almost certainly a slightly earlier work.",1
3761,['17802-706goya.jpg'],"There is, in fact, little reason to doubt that the woman reading a letter, standing with her companion and a dog in front of a group of washerwomen, is a genre subject like the earlier tapestry cartoons and other decorative paintings.",0
3762,['17802-706goya.jpg'],"But the composition is less contrived and, as in many other works, chiefly the uncommissioned ones, it appears to be based on a scene that the artist had witnessed and recorded on the spot or from memory.",1
3763,['17802-706goya.jpg'],This was one of four paintings by Goya in the collection of King Louis Philippe which had been obtained in Madrid from Goya's son,1
3764,['24478-portrait.jpg'],"The painting is in a poor state of conservation, the colours have altered dramatically.",1

3768,['24478-portrait.jpg'],"The portrait can be compared with various portraits by Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, especially the bystanders in the scene of St Peter preaching.",1

3776,['23922-tavern.jpg'],The representation of figures playing musical instruments in 'cultivated' domestic interiors (the direct descendants of Caravaggio's Lute Player and Musicians) disappeared.,1
3777,['23922-tavern.jpg'],Within the space of a very few years they were replaced by large numbers of representations of concerts in public places and 'popular' locations.,1
3778,['23922-tavern.jpg'],One of the earlier examples of this new trend is Bartolomeo Manfredi's Tavern Scene with a Lute Player.,1
3779,['23922-tavern.jpg'],"One characteristic of the painting, besides the presence of the lute player in a non-musical context (he simply accompanies a scene in which people are eating and drinking), is the absence of a musical score, an attribute of 'cultivated' musical painting.",1

3826,['14954-tahiti01.jpg'],Gauguin's Tahitian paintings celebrate the lushness and mysterious splendour of his new environment.,1
3827,['14954-tahiti01.jpg'],"At the same time they are seldom correct pictures of Tahitian life, from an anthropological standpoint, but rather feature recastings and recombinations of objects and persons taken out of their normal settings, as was the case with several of his paintings done in Brittany.",1
3828,['14954-tahiti01.jpg'],The most important paintings executed during Gauguin's first stay in Tahiti are the Ia Orana Maria (Hail Mary) and The Spectre Watches over Her (Manao Tupapau).,1
3829,['14954-tahiti01.jpg'],In Ia Orana Maria Gauguin places the Christian story into a setting where both the figures and the vegetation are Polynesian.,1

3832,['14954-tahiti01.jpg'],"The apparently effortless fusion of Christian iconography with Tahitian subject matter is in fact carefully contrived, with the poses of the background figures lifted from the relief carving on the Javanese temple of Borobudur, photographs of which Gauguin had taken with him to Tahiti",1
3833,['21307-09magdam.jpg'],Around 1620 a group of young French painters developed interesting derivations from works by Caravaggio.,1
3834,['21307-09magdam.jpg'],Among these we find Georges de la Tour.,1
3835,['21307-09magdam.jpg'],"In his canvases he adopted the strong light and shade contrasts characteristics of Caravaggio's school, although in his chiaroscuro effects he preferred the Nordic tenebrosi's use of artificial light, such as candles and torches, which produces a dazzling effect and creates a more transcendental atmosphere that does not include the supernatural.",1

3857,['04123-peasants.jpg'],"While in Italy, Berchem made many drawings of the landscape of the Roman Campagna, its cattle and peasants.",1
3858,['04123-peasants.jpg'],"On his return to Haarlem Berchem quarried this rich material throughout a long and extremely productive career, painting (and etching) hundreds of Italianate pastoral scenes.",1
3859,['04123-peasants.jpg'],"As is evident from this painting, he interpreted the Italian landscape and the life of its peasants in an idyllic manner, emphasizing its timeless continuity by the inclusion of antique monuments.",1

3873,['38716-girlhold.jpg'],These genre scenes were often produced in pairs.,1
3874,['38716-girlhold.jpg'],Terbrugghen's figures have often been interpreted as allegories of the Five Senses.,1

3895,['38632-bp_advic.jpg'],(The coin is omitted in the engraving Goethe knew).,1
3896,['38632-bp_advic.jpg'],In the Berlin version the passage is rubbed; a former owner may have had it painted over because she or he found it an embarrassing allusion.,1
3897,['38632-bp_advic.jpg'],"The Amsterdam version does not show the coin either, but its original paint surface is generally abraded; thus it is impossible to tell if it ever included the tell-tale coin.",1
3898,['38632-bp_advic.jpg'],Ter Borch's psychology is so delicate that the  common scenes he repeatedly painted are raised to the level of highly civilized life.,1

3930,['15943-venus.jpg'],"She stretches one arm behind her head, making a long, continuous slope of body whose gentle curves echo the hills of the landscape behind and suggest some form of connection between the female depicted and nature.",0
3931,['15943-venus.jpg'],"Painted at just the moment when Venice was defending its claims on the terra firma, it may, therefore, be possible to read Venus (Venere) as Venice (Venezia).Venus's sensuality is heightened by her red lips and by the deep red velvet and white satin drapery upon which her creamy body lies.",1
3932,['15943-venus.jpg'],"Significantly, she is asleep, so the issue of decorum is bypassed.",0
3933,['15943-venus.jpg'],Her sleep implies dreaming and transport of the figure to another world.,1

3938,['15943-venus.jpg'],"The drawing is only approximative, with the outlines blurred to produce a gradual transition between the barely modeled flesh and the surrounding surface.",1
3939,['15943-venus.jpg'],"But the edges are nonetheless legible, and they form a flattened lozenge-shaped, pale, collage-like form lying close to the picture plane, a device favoured over juxtapositions of darks and lights to conjure up an illusion of three-dimensionality.",0
3940,['15943-venus.jpg'],Giorgione fully exploited the sensuous potential of both the medium and the subject.,1
3941,['15943-venus.jpg'],There is a decidedly erotic air to the totally unselfconscious young woman whose pale flesh is contrasted to the silky cloth.,0
3942,['15943-venus.jpg'],If compared with Titian's Venus of Urbino the differences between the two become clear since Titian has taken over the pose and the figural type almost verbatim from Giorgione; they are differences of temperament and personality more than of time passed.,1
3943,['15943-venus.jpg'],"If the Sleeping Venus was actually completed by Titian, as is frequently assumed, the overall effect remains tightly connected with Giorgione's style, and one might also suppose that it falls chronologically near the end of his short career, for we should assume that it was left unfinished at his death",1
